<h2>EXPLANATORY NOTE TO NEW EDITION</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Since</span> the publication of this volume two years ago as
"Handicraft and Recreation for Girls," it has occurred
to us that "Recreations" alone much more accurately defines
the contents, for the handicrafts represented are only
those that in effect are recreations. Therefore we have
thought it best to drop the word Handicraft and issue the
new edition under the more appropriate title, "Recreations
for Girls."</p>

<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">This</span> book, like a girl's life, is divided into two parts:
occupation and amusement, or handicraft and recreation.</p>

<p>It is not equally divided, for handicraft is so much more
like play than work, and is so entertaining in itself, we find
difficulty in drawing a distinct line between that and recreation.
The one insists upon blending with the other and the
book, after all, is a book of entertainment.</p>

<p>With the old handicrafts coming back into favor and
new ones constantly being brought forward, a girl's life
may be full of delightful employment. To work with joyous
enthusiasm and self-reliant energy, as well as to play
with light-hearted enjoyment, cannot fail to make her sensible,
wholesome, and happy, and it is with this end in view
that we have written and illustrated the book. Our wish
is to help our girl friends to make the most of their girlhood
and to enjoy it to its fullest extent.</p>

<p>We have had practical experience in the actual working
out of all the various handicrafts and recreations, and therefore
give only that which we know can be well and easily
done by the average girl.</p>

<p>Thanks are due to the <em>Delineator</em>, <em>Harper's Bazar</em>, <em>Woman's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
Home Companion</em>, and <cite>Good Housekeeping</cite>, for their courtesy
in promptly returning for this work the original drawings
and material used in their respective magazines.</p>

</div><div class='drop-cap'>THERE is so much poetry,
romance, and history associated
with the distaff
and spindle, and later
with the old spinning-wheel, that
we have looked
upon them with a feeling
almost of awe, certainly
with a reverence for the
gentle hands that spun so
industriously generations
ago. But it has now occurred
to us that we too
may set the wheel a-humming,
taking up with enthusiastic
eagerness the work laid down by our great-grandmothers
so many years ago. The song of even the
athletic girl will soon be like Martha's when she sings in
the market-place:</div>

<div class='center'>
"I can spin, sir,"<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>and the wheel will no longer be set aside as a relic of an
industry past and gone.</div>

<p>All the old handicrafts are coming back again, and ere
long we shall be as proud as the maids in Revolutionary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
times of our hand-spun and hand-woven fabrics. To be
able to spin and weave is to be accomplished in the newest
as well as the oldest of household arts.</p>

<p>Is the old spinning-wheel in the attic, neglected and covered
with dust, or in the parlor, decked in all its bravery of
blue ribbons and snowy flax? Bring it out, wherever it
may be, and for the first time in many years it shall buzz
and whirr, while a girl's slender fingers part the flax and a
girl's light foot rests upon the treadle. Look well to</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>The Wheel</div>

<div class='unindent'>and see that none of its parts are missing. There must be
the bench, of course, with its treadle and wheel, then the
slender rod which is tied loosely at the lower end to the
cross-piece of the treadle (<a href="#Fig_1">Fig. 1</a>), and caught at the looped
upper end to the little, curved-metal crank that extends at
right angles from one end of the wheel's axle (<a href="#Fig_2">Fig. 2</a>).</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>The two slanting uprights which hold the wheel in place
are slotted at the upper ends, and in these slots rests the
axle. A little peg, slipped through two holes in one of the
uprights, keeps the axle from slipping out of place (<a href="#Fig_3">Fig. 3</a>).</p>

<p>The frame that holds</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>The Spindle</div>

<div class='unindent'>belongs in the position shown in the illustration of the
spinning-wheel. By turning the handle that extends out
from the upper end of the bench this frame may be moved
slightly forward or backward when it is necessary to loosen
or tighten the band on the wheel.</div>

</div>
<p>In the two uprights of the spindle-frame there must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
leather rings like <a href="#Fig_4">Fig. 4</a>, one ring in each upright. The
narrow strip extending outward from the ring is pushed
through the hole in
the upright, and the
edge of the ring fitted
into the little grooves
just above and below
one of the holes (<a href="#Fig_5">Fig. 5</a>). These two leather
rings hold the ends of
the spindle, which
can be easily taken
out and put in by
bending one of the rings backward or
slightly turning one of the uprights.
<a href="#Fig_6">Fig. 6</a> shows the spindle with the spool,
or bobbin, and the small, double-grooved
wheel. The spindle proper is simply
the metal rod and horseshoe-shaped
piece of wood with its two rows of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
little hooks or teeth. Besides the wheel and spindle there
must be</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>The Distaff</div>

<div class='unindent'>and the arm that holds it. The arm is an upright with a
rod extending out at right angles from the upper end. The
lower end of the upright is slipped into a hole at one corner
of the highest part of the bench.</div>

</div>

<p>The distaff, which the mountaineers of Kentucky call
the "rock," is a thing you can make for yourself if your
wheel happens to have lost its own. Many are cut from the
top points of pine-trees which grow like <a href="#Fig_7">Fig. 7</a>, and dogwood
also is sometimes used. The tip of your Christmas
tree will be just the thing. Strip off the bark, bring the
four branches up, and tie at the top to the middle stem (<a href="#Fig_8">Fig. 8</a>). Let the lower end of the stem extend about four inches
below the branches and whittle it down to fit in the hole in
the distaff-arm.</p>

<p>These are all the parts of the spinning-wheel, but before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
you can "see the wheels go round" every piece of metal
must be</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>Thoroughly Cleaned</div>

<div class='unindent'>and freed from rust. Rub first with kerosene oil and then
with the finest emery paper. Be very careful in polishing
the teeth that you do not bend or break them, as it will
not be easy to have them replaced. In fact, it is difficult
to replace any part of the wheel, and though it has
lasted several generations, careless handling may put it past
repair.</div>

<span class="caption">Fig. <a id="Fig_9">9</a>.&mdash;Proper size of cord for

</div>

<p>When the cleaning is finished,
grease with lard the parts where
there is any friction. The slots
that hold the axle, the spindle-stem,
and the metal arm, where the
treadle-rod rests upon it, all need
lubricating.</p>

<p>The best</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>Band for the Wheel</div>

<div class='unindent'>is hand spun, but at present it is
possible to obtain them only of old-fashioned
spinners who make their
own bands. You can, however, make
a band of cotton cord, such as is
used for cording dresses. <a href="#Fig_9">Fig. 9</a>
gives the exact size. The length of
cord for a wheel measuring eighteen
and a half inches in diameter is about ten feet five inches.
This allows for a lap of one inch at the joint. Sew together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
with silk, wrapping and sewing until the joint is almost
invisible.</div>

</div>


<div class='sectiontitle'>To Adjust the Band</div>

<div class='unindent'>loop it together, making
it double (<a href="#Fig_10">Fig. 10</a>), lift the
wheel from the sockets, and
slip the band over it. Fit
one part of the band into
one of the grooves of the
wheel, the other part into
the other groove, allowing
it to cross at the bottom
(Letter B, <a href="#Fig_11">Fig. 11</a>). Take
the spindle from its frame and fit the bands into the
groove in the end of the bobbin (Letter C, <a href="#Fig_6">Fig. 6</a>) and
into the first groove in the small wheel (Letter D, <a href="#Fig_6">Fig. 6</a>).</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>The Flax</div>

<div class='unindent'>may be obtained from any linen-thread factory and can be
bought by the pound or half-pound. It is graded by color,
the darkest being the cheapest and the whitest the most
expensive. For practice-work the cheapest is as good as
the more expensive. When you have learned to spin a fine,
even thread you may choose the color in reference to the
article you intend to make.</div>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 317px;">

<span class="caption">The spinning-wheel.</span>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>Open your hank of flax, take part of it, and spread
thinly over the distaff, wrapping it around and around.
Put on several layers, each almost as thin as a spider-web,
extending it out widely and smoothly each time.</p>

<p>You may think the ribbon tied on the distaff of your
parlor wheel is merely for ornament, but it is not. The
bands hold the flax in place while it is being spun, and
a crisp, dainty, pretty-colored ribbon is just as useful for
the purpose as one that is old and faded, and it is far prettier
to look upon. Wrap the ribbon around the flax on the
distaff, beginning at the bottom, cross it, and tie as shown in
illustration of the spinning-wheel.</p>

<p>Though everything is ready, before attempting to
spin,</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>Practice,</div>

<div class='unindent'>simply working the treadle until you can manage that part
of the work mechanically and give your whole attention to
your hands.</div>

<p>It seems a simple thing to work the treadle, but you will
find that without previous practice you will forget to make
your foot go in the absorbing interest of getting the flax
ready to run on the spindle. Curb your impatience a little
while therefore, and resolutely turn the distaff, with its
pretty load, away from you. Place one foot on the treadle,
give the large wheel a turn to the right, or away from the
spindle, and try to keep a steady, even motion with your
foot. The jerks caused by uneven pedalling will always
break the thread, so you must learn to make the wheel turn
smoothly and easily, without hurry and without stopping.
Some spinners place only the toe of the foot on the treadle,
others rest on it the heel also; it matters little which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
method you adopt so long as the wheel turns evenly. When
you are quite satisfied that you can keep the wheel going
without giving it a thought you may begin</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>To Spin.</div>

<p>From the lowest ends of the flax draw down several
strands and twist them with your fingers into a thread long
enough to reach easily the bobbin on the spindle. Pass the
end of the thread through the hole in the end of the spindle
nearest to you (Letter A, <a href="#Fig_6">Fig. 6</a>), carry it across and over
the upper row of teeth and tie to the bobbin (<a href="#Fig_6">Fig. 6</a>). Start
your wheel going, and, forgetting the action of your foot,
give your undivided attention to drawing out the flax.
Hold the strands lightly with your left hand and with your
right keep constantly pulling them down and at the same
time twisting them slightly. See illustration on first page.
All this time you must keep the flax from matting and tangling
and the twist from running up into the mass of flax on
the distaff. Only practice will make perfect in this work,
though the knack may come suddenly and you will wonder
at your first clumsy attempts. The little fluster and excitement
one feels in beginning and the hurry to get the flax
into shape for the spindle is a drawback that practice will
also overcome.</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>When the Thread Breaks,</div>

<div class='unindent'>as it will again and again at first, thread your spindle as
before, tie the new thread to the broken end and begin
once more. A better way to mend the thread when you
are really doing good work is to unwind a little from
the bobbin, thread it backward through the spindle, bring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
the end up to meet the end from the distaff, and let the
two lap three or four inches; then moisten your fingers
and twist the threads together, making one thread
again.</div>

<div class='sectiontitle'>Moistening the Fingers</div>

<div class='unindent'>occasionally is a good thing while twisting, as it makes a
smoother thread. In the old days the spinner kept a cocoa-nut-shell,
filled with water, tied to the lower part of the
spindle-frame, into which she daintily dipped the tips of her
fingers when necessary. A finger-bowl or cup of water
near by will answer the same purpose.</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<div class='chaptertitle'>WEAVING ON A HOME-MADE
LOOM</div>

</div><div><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div><div class='drop-cap'>IT is easier than sewing or knitting
or crocheting, and comes so natural
to many of us that one would almost
think we should know how to weave
without being taught. Why, even
some of the birds do a kind of weaving
in their pretty, irregular fashion,
and it was probably from the birds
and other small, wild creatures that
the earliest human mothers took their lessons in weaving,
and learned to make the mats for their babies to sleep on
and baskets for carrying their food. No one knows how
long ago these first baskets and mats were woven, but in the
beginning weaving was done without looms. Afterward
rude frames were tied together and hung from the limbs
of trees, then softer and more flexible material was used
and finer fabrics were woven. To this day almost the
same kind of looms are used by the Indians in our far
Western country, many miles away from the roar and
clatter of machinery, and on them are woven the wonderfully
beautiful Navajo blankets for which Eastern people
are willing to pay such large sums.</div>

</div>

<p>If it is natural to weave, it should also be natural to
make one's own loom, and</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>The Pin Loom</div>

<div class='unindent'>is simple in both the making and the working, with material
usually close at hand. The necessary wood you will
find at the nearest carpenter-shop, if not in your own home,
and for the rest, a paper of strong,
large-size pins, a yard of colored
cord, and one ordinary carpet-tack
are all that is needed.</div>

<p>Make the frame for the loom of
a smooth piece of soft pine-board,
fifteen inches long by nine inches
wide (<a href="#Fig_12">Fig. 12</a>). Make the heddles
of two flat sticks, nine inches long,
half an inch wide, and one-eighth
of an inch thick (Figs. 13 and 14).
From another flat stick of the same
thickness, nine inches long by one
inch wide, make the shuttle (<a href="#Fig_15">Fig. 15</a>).</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 179px;">

<span class="caption">Fig. <a id="Fig_14">14</a>.&mdash;Heddle.</span>
</div>

<p>With a pencil and ruler draw
two straight lines across the board,
the first one inch and a half from the top edge, the other
two inches and a half from the bottom edge. This will
make the lines just eleven inches apart. On these lines,
beginning one inch from the side edge of the board, make a
row of dots exactly one-quarter
of an inch apart, twenty-nine
dots on each line, as in <a href="#Fig_12">Fig. 12</a>.
At each corner of the board,
one inch above the upper line
and one inch below the lower
line, draw a short line, and on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
each short line, three-quarters of an inch from the side
edge, make one dot.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. <a id="Fig_15">15</a>.&mdash;The shuttle.</span>
</div>

<p>With a small tack-hammer drive a pin in each of the
twenty-nine dots on each long
line, and in each single dot on
the four short lines (<a href="#Fig_12">Fig. 12</a>).
When driving in the pins let
them all slant evenly outward,
the ones on the top lines slanting toward the upper edge
of the board, those on the lower lines slanting toward
the bottom edge, as in <a href="#Fig_16">Fig. 16</a>.
Now lay your board aside
where nothing will be placed on
top of it, and make your heddles.</p>

</div>


<div class='sectiontitle'>The Heddles</div>

<div class='unindent'>are for lifting the threads of the warp so that the shuttle
may be passed through. One heddle is left perfectly plain,
like <a href="#Fig_13">Fig. 13</a>. The other is cut in notches on one edge like
<a href="#Fig_14">Fig. 14</a>.</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 182px;">

<span class="caption">Fig. <a id="Fig_17">17</a>.&mdash;The marked-off notches in
heddle.</span>
</div>

<p>Along the entire length of one of the sticks rule a line
dividing it exactly in the middle
(<a href="#Fig_17">Fig. 17</a>). On this line, beginning
three-quarters of an
inch from the end of the stick,
mark off spaces one-quarter of
an inch apart, making thirty-one
dots. At the upper edge of the stick mark off the
same number of spaces exactly opposite those on the line.
Then draw straight lines connecting the upper and lower
dots, extending the first and last lines entirely across the
stick (<a href="#Fig_17">Fig. 17</a>.) At a point on the upper edge, exactly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
in the middle between the first two lines, start a slanting
line and bring it down to meet the second line where it
touches the long line. Between the second and third
lines draw another slanting line to meet the first at the
bottom, forming a V. Leave the third line, and make
another V at the
fourth, and so go the
length of the heddle,
drawing a V at every
other short line. At
the top between the
V's make smaller V's,
as in <a href="#Fig_17">Fig. 17</a>. With
a sharp knife cut out
these notches, bringing
the large ones
quite down to the
middle line (<a href="#Fig_17">Fig. 17</a>).
On the end lines just
below the middle line
bore a hole with a
small gimlet or a hat-pin
heated red-hot at
Letter A in <a href="#Fig_17">Fig. 17</a>.
Indeed the notches,
too, may be made
with a hat-pin by laying
the red-hot end across the edge of the stick at the top
of the line, and pressing it down while rubbing it back and
forth. If you are unused to handling a knife, burning the
notches will be the easier way. You can shape and trim
them off afterward with the knife.</p>

<div class='sectiontitle'>The Shuttle.</div>

<p>Curve the corners at each end as in <a href="#Fig_15">Fig. 15</a>. Sharpen one
end down to a thin edge and in the other end cut an eye
two inches long and one-quarter of an inch wide (<a href="#Fig_15">Fig. 15</a>).
Cut your yard of colored cord in half, pass the end of one
piece through one of the holes in the notched heddle, the
end of the other piece through the hole in the opposite end
of the heddle, and tie each end of the cords to one of the
pins at the four corners of the board, drawing the cords
taut. This will fasten the heddle in its place across the
loom (<a href="#Fig_12">Fig. 12</a>).</p>

<p>Near the bottom of the board, directly below the last
pin at the right on the long line, drive the carpet-tack to
serve as a cleat for fastening the end of the warp. All that
now remains to be done is</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>To Adjust the Warp,</div>

<div class='unindent'>and your loom will be ready for weaving. The threads
which extend up and down, or from the top to the bottom
of the loom, are called the warp. Soft, rather coarse knitting-cotton
makes a good warp for
almost anything woven on a small
loom.</div>

<img src="images/i_034.png" width="136" height="183" alt="drawing" />
<span class="caption">Fig. <a id="Fig_18">18</a>.&mdash;Adjusting the warp.</span>
</div>

<p>Tie the end of the warp securely
to the first pin on the long line at the
upper left-hand corner of the loom
(<a href="#Fig_18">Fig. 18</a>). Bring the string down and
around the first two pins on the lower
line, up again and around the second
and third pins on the upper line, and
then down and around the third and
fourth pins on the lower line. Up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
again, down again, crossing two pins each time, back and
forth until the last pin on the lower line has been reached.
Wrap the warp around this pin several times, and then
around the tack, tying it here so that it cannot slip. The
warp must lie flat on the board where it passes around the
pins, and in stringing up it must be drawn rather tight,
though not with sufficient force to pull the pins out of place.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 204px;">

<span class="caption">Fig. <a id="Fig_19">19</a>.&mdash;Putting in the second heddle.</span>
</div>

<p>Turn the heddle on edge, the notches up, and slip the
threads of the warp into the notches, one thread in each
notch. This, you will see, divides the warp into upper and
lower threads, and forms
what is called the shed.
While the threads are separated
take the other heddle
and darn it in and out above
the first heddle, taking up
the lower threads and bringing
the heddle over the
upper ones as in <a href="#Fig_19">Fig. 19</a>.</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>The Woof</div>

<div class='unindent'>is the thread which crosses
the warp and usually covers
it entirely. The material
to use for woof will depend
upon what you are going
to make. Germantown wool is used for the woof of the
miniature Navajo blanket shown in the illustration. The
warp is knitting-cotton.</div>

<p>This is</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>The Way to Weave a Navajo</div>

<div class='unindent'>blanket; simpler things you can easily make after this first
lesson: Of Germantown wool you will need three colors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a><br /><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
which are the colors most frequently used by the Indians&mdash;red
(scarlet), white, and black, about half a hank of each.
Take five yards of white wool, fold one end over a two-yard
length, fold again, and push the double end through
the eye of the shuttle (<a href="#Fig_20">Fig. 20</a>).</div>

<span class="caption">Fig. <a id="Fig_20">20</a>.&mdash;The threaded shuttle.</span>
</div>

<p>Tie the long end of the wool to the first pin at the lower
left-hand corner of the loom, on the long line, making a
tight knot and pushing
it down close to the
board (<a href="#Fig_21">Fig. 21</a>).</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 245px;">
<img src="images/i_037b.png" width="245" height="203" alt="drawing" />
<span class="caption">Fig. <a id="Fig_21">21</a>.&mdash;Starting the woof.</span>
</div>

<p>With the notched
heddle on edge push
the shuttle through
the shed&mdash;that is, between
the upper and
lower threads of the
warp. Draw it out on
the other side, then
turn the heddle down,
notched edge toward
you, and stand the plain
heddle on edge. This will lift the lower threads of the
warp above the others and make them the upper ones.
Push the shuttle back through the shed, lay the plain heddle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
flat, and stand up the notched heddle. Weaving from the
left, the notched heddle always stands, while the plain one
lies flat. Weaving from the right, the plain heddle stands,
and the notched one is turned down.</p>

<p>Do not draw the woof tight across the warp. When you
have passed the shuttle through, leave the thread like <a href="#Fig_21">Fig. 21</a>, and then push it down firmly with your finger-tips until
it lies close to the pins.</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>A Coarse Comb</div>

<div class='unindent'>with no fine teeth is very good to use for packing the woof,
and takes the place of what is called the lay. While the
woof is looped out like <a href="#Fig_21">Fig. 21</a>, comb it down toward you
with the comb, and it will fit in evenly between the threads
of the warp. As the woof of the Navajo blanket must be
very tightly packed, use first the comb and then your fingers
to push it down and make it compact.</div>

<p>Weave back and forth until all the wool in the shuttle is
used. If the end of the woof extends beyond the last thread
of the warp on either side, turn it back and weave it under
and over several threads, and start a new piece with the
end just lapping the old. The ends of the woof must never
be allowed to extend beyond the warp at the sides. It is
not necessary to tie the new piece of woof; the tight packing
will hold it in place.</p>

<p>In this case the new woof must be of the red wool.
Weave it across twice, or once over and back, making a
very narrow red stripe, then cut it off and thread the shuttle
with white. Weave the white twice across, then change
to black and weave a stripe one-quarter of an inch wide.
Above the black weave another narrow white stripe and
another narrow red one. Put a long thread of white wool<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
in the shuttle, and weave a white stripe one inch wide. You
will have to thread the shuttle twice for this, as too long a
thread will make so large a bunch that it will be difficult to
pass it through the shed. After the white stripe weave
another black, white, and red stripe like the first, then
another inch-wide white stripe. Once more weave a black,
a white, and a red stripe. Begin with the narrow black,
follow with the narrow white, and then weave a wider red
stripe, taking the thread four times across. After the red
the narrow white, and then the narrow black stripe.</p>

<p>This last stripe is the lower border of</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>The Central Pattern</div>

<div class='unindent'>of the blanket, where your weaving will become more
difficult, and at the same time more interesting.</div>

<span class="caption">Figs. <a id="Fig_22"></a>22 and <a id="Fig_23"></a>23.&mdash;Weaving the centre stripe.</span>
</div>

<p>Thread the shuttle with a long piece of red wool and
weave it once across from the left, turn back and weave
through five threads of the
warp, draw the shuttle out
and weave back again to the
edge; again weave through
the five threads, then back
as shown at B in <a href="#Fig_22">Fig. 22</a>.
Turn here and do not take
up the last thread of the
warp; pass the shuttle under
three threads, turn on
the next thread, and bring
it back under four threads
(C, <a href="#Fig_22">Fig. 22</a>), once more under the three threads, turning on
the next as before, but passing back under two threads
only. Turn on the next thread (D), and pass under three.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Back under two threads (E), turn as before on the next
thread under two, turn, back under two (F), turn, under
one, turn on the next, under two (G), turn, under one,
turn on the next, back under two, and unthread the shuttle,
leaving the woof hanging.</p>

<p>Begin with a new piece of red wool, follow the same
direction, and weave another red point on the next five
threads, then a third one which will take in the last warp-thread
on the left. You will notice in the diagram that the
woof always turns twice on the same thread of warp.</p>

<p>When the three red points are finished fill in the spaces
between with black (<a href="#Fig_23">Fig. 23</a>), then continue to weave the
black up into points as you did the red, making two whole
and two half black diamonds. Leave the woof quite loose
when you make a turn in weaving, and the space left between
the red and black will fill up in packing.</p>

<p>Take up the end of the red wool left at the top of the
first red point, and weave in the space between the half and
first black diamond, then break off. Take the next red end
and fill in between the two whole diamonds, then the next,
and fill in between the whole and the last half diamond.
This will give you a pattern of black diamonds on a red
ground. Weave the last of the red woof once across, then
break off and weave a black, white, and red stripe like the
one forming the lower border of the pattern. Finish the
blanket with the wide white stripes and narrow colored
ones like those first woven.</p>

<p>To take the work from the loom, cut the threads between
the pins at the top of the loom, and with quick but
gentle jerks pull it off the lower row of pins. Tie together
the first and third loose ends of the warp close to the edge
of the blanket, then the second and fourth threads, and so
on across, then cut the ends off rather close to the knots.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>The little Navajo blanket woven in this way will closely
resemble the real Indian blanket in texture, pattern, and
colors.</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>Blankets for Dolls' Beds</div>

<div class='unindent'>may also be woven of fine white wool and finished with a
pretty pink or blue border at each end. A wash-cloth, soft
and pleasant to the touch, you can weave in half an hour
with candle-wick for woof. This should not be packed
tightly, but woven with rather a loose mesh. Then there
are cunning little rag rugs to be made for the dolls' house,
with colored rags for the woof. But so many materials may
be woven on your home-made loom, that it will be a pleasure
for you to discover them for yourself.</div>

<p>When the first knot (H, <a href="#Fig_27">Fig. 27</a>) is tied, take the pin out
of the string E and stick it in the string G, according to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>

you will have the knot H and the string G firm and tight
to the board while you tie the two loose strings F and
E together, forming the knot K. Pin this down to the
board and remove the pin from the string G and place
it in the string N, leaving M and G free to be knotted
together.</p>

<p>Continue tying the strings in this way until you have
made the first row of knots across the board, always using
pins to hold the boundary-strings securely to the board on
each side of the two you are tying. As each knot is formed,
pin it to the board and allow the pins to remain in the first
row until the second row of knots has been made.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_29">Fig. 29</a> shows the beginning of the third row of knots in
the knot P, the pin being taken from the first knot, H,
ready to be placed in the knot P. Form row after row of
meshes by knotting the strings until the netting comes too
near the bottom of the board to work comfortably, then
slip the top loops off from the tacks and hang a portion of
the net over the top of the board, allowing a lower row of
meshes to hang on the tacks.</p>

with strong strings the short loose ends of the strands
securely to the string forming the mesh each side of the
knot. Remove the net from the board and make</p>

lap one end to the distance of
an inch over the other and sew
the two lapped ends firmly together;
then bind them neatly
around and around with string.
Bring the two edges or sides

two ends (V V, <a href="#Fig_34">Fig. 34</a>). Tie a strong string on each end

a chair; you will then have a circle of heavy cord
securely suspended in mid-air. Cut twenty-four lengths
of twine, each twenty-five inches long; double each piece
and fasten all the strands on the circle of heavy cord
in the same way you made the fringe on the hammock
(X X, <a href="#Fig_34">Fig. 34</a>), except that this time the strands must be
quite a distance apart. Let all the spaces between the
strands be equal. Having fastened the lengths of twine on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a><br /><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the circle, net them together exactly as you netted the
hammock, but you must depend upon your eye to keep the
meshes even and of the same size, as there will be no board
with lines to guide you (<a href="#Fig_34">Fig. 34</a>). Tie the knots in circular
rows, going around on both sides of the circle for each row.
Continue the meshes until within three and a half inches
of the bottom, then tie the two sides together, closing the
bottom of the bag and forming the fringe shown in <a href="#Fig_33">Fig. 33</a>.</div>

<p>With some firm straws and more string we will make</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>A Sash-Curtain</div>

<div class='unindent'>for the window of your own room, as the little girl is doing
in the illustration. Loop about thirty strands on the same
number of tacks, in the manner in which you hung those
for the hammock (<a href="#Fig_26">Fig. 26</a>). Make one row of knots, and
before forming the next row slide a piece of straw one inch
long over the two strings which are to be knotted together;
the ends of the string must be moistened and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
brought together in a point in order that they may more
easily be threaded through the straw. The letter R in
<a href="#Fig_35">Fig. 35</a> shows the straw with the ends of the string run
through it, and U gives a straw higher up on the strings.
After each straw is put into place, knot the strings immediately
underneath to prevent
the straw from sliding
out of position.</div>

<p><a href="#Fig_35">Fig. 35</a> shows how to
manage the work. It is
almost exactly like that of
the hammock, the only difference
being the threading
on of the straws which hold
the strings in place without
a knot at the top (see W in
<a href="#Fig_35">Fig. 35</a>). Let the bottom
of the net end in a fringe.
Take the loops off from
the tacks when the curtain
is finished, and slide them
on a straight, slender stick,
which you can fasten to the window by resting the ends
of the stick through loops of tape tacked on the sides
of the window-frame at the right distance up from the
ledge of the window.</p>

On the centre of the space along the upper side of the

place of ordinary twine. For very wide out-of-door veranda-shades,
select the strongest cat-tails and dig out about
two inches of pith from the large end of one cat-tail very
cautiously to avoid breaking the sides; then push the small
end of another cat-tail into the opening (Figs. 59, 60, 61);
weave these long pieces together as you wove the single
reeds in the first curtain, using extra lines of weave. If
you cannot obtain cat-tails, take other reeds; or cut some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>

<span class="caption">The grass hammock.</span>
</div>
<p>Some of this grass measures
twenty-five inches in length.
It does not grow on stalks, but
the blade appears to spring
directly from the root, and it
is smooth and pliable. You
may find orchard-grass almost
any where, generally in neglected
corners and close to fences
where the scythe does not
reach.</p>

<p>Take eight or ten of the
blades of this grass and tie
them together at the root-ends
as in <a href="#Fig_67">Fig. 67</a>, drawing the knot tight as in <a href="#Fig_68">Fig. 68</a>. Stick
a pin through just below the knot and fasten to your knee;
then lift two of the grasses at the right-hand side, and tie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
them together about one inch below the pin (<a href="#Fig_68">Fig. 68</a>). Tie
the next two grasses together in the same manner, the next,
and the next, until you have tied them all in pairs (<a href="#Fig_69">Fig. 69</a>).
Make the second row by separating the pairs of the first
and tying one grass of
one pair to the neighboring
grass of the next
pair, making the knots
one inch below the first
row. This leaves the
first and last grasses
hanging loose (<a href="#Fig_70">Fig. 70</a>).
On the third row the
first and last grasses are
tied in once more (<a href="#Fig_70">Fig. 70</a>). On the fourth they
are left again, and so
they alternate until the
hammock is finished.
Keep the rows of knots
at even distances apart,
and make the hammock as long as the
length of the grass will allow. Leave
about three inches of the grass below the
last row of knots, and then tie the ends
together as in the illustration. Swing
the little hammock between the low-hanging
branches of a tree; put your dolly
in it and let the summer breezes rock
her to sleep while you sing:</p>

<p>Bunch together seven
fine, strong seed-grass
stalks and tie just below
the blossoms, with the
root-end of your long-blade
grass (<a href="#Fig_71">Fig. 71</a>). The
stems of the seed-grasses
are the spokes, the long
grass the weaver. Turn
the blossom-ends down,
the stem-ends up, and close
to where it is tied, begin
to weave the long grass in
and out, under one spoke,
over the next, under the
third, over the fourth, going
around and around
spirally until the end of
the weaver is reached,
then tie it to one of the
spokes. Keep forcing the
spokes farther and farther
apart as you weave until
the holder is shaped like a cone. As you see in the illustration,
the weaver never passes over one of the spokes twice
in succession. In one row it goes over a spoke, in the next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
row under it, in the third over again, and so on. In order
that it may always come this way you must have an uneven
number of spokes. Four will not
do, nor six, nor eight, but five, seven,
or nine spokes will bring the weave
out all right.</p>

case the method is the same.</p>


<p>In a board, at regular distances apart, along a straight

nails is three inches
the ring must be
three inches below
the line. Catch the
ring to each strand

and thread to hold
it in place. Bring
the third and sixth

row of rings that the first row of rings is below the line of
nails (Letter C, <a href="#Fig_83">Fig. 83</a>). Bring the third and fourth strands
together with a ring, the fifth and sixth, continuing the
original pairing of the strands until the row is complete.
The third row of rings brings together again the second
and fourth strands, the third and sixth, as in the first row,
and the fourth row of rings goes back to pairing the first
and second, third and fourth strands.</p>

head of the tassel by wrapping closely with twine a short
distance below the ring, or you may slip on several of the
brass rings as a finish.</p>

<p>The board on which you make your netting need not be
any longer than is convenient to handle, for when one part

<div class='chaptertitle'>HOW TO WEAVE
A SPLINT BASKET</div>

  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_083.png" width="158" height="182" alt="Y"/>
</div><div><br /><br /><br /></div><div class='drop-cap'>YOUR enthusiasm will begin when
you find how easily the splint can
be cut and shaped after it has
soaked for a while in water. It is
delightful to work with, almost as
soft and pliable as ribbon, while
having more substance. Although
there is apparently such diversity
in the material shown in the illustration,
it all comes from one roll of splint, which is uniform
in width and thickness.</div>


<p>A basket measuring about six inches in diameter and
three inches in height is a convenient size on which to
learn.</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>Open Your Roll of Splint,</div>

<div class='unindent'>put two pieces to soak in a bowlful of cold water, and let
them remain twenty minutes. Have ready a clean lap-board,
a pair of large scissors, and an old towel. The
lap-board not only serves for a work-table, but also keeps
the water out of your lap.</div>

<span class="caption">Weaving the sides of basket with long weaver.</span>
</div>

<p>Wipe the dripping water from the splint, and cut off six
pieces nineteen inches long; then cut these into sixteen
strips one-half inch wide, for the spokes of the basket. Do
not attempt to tear the splint, for it will not tear evenly.
From the other piece of splint cut four strips for weavers,
making the first one-half of an inch wide, the next one-fourth
of an inch wide, another one-eighth of an inch wide,
and the last one-sixteenth of an inch wide. Place all the
weavers in the water and leave them until you are ready to
begin weaving.</p>

they are perfectly straight and flat; then number them all
by writing the number with a pencil on each end of every
spoke; see diagram

spokes in front of
you on the lap-board
crossing the first four

<span class="caption">Fig. <a id="Fig_87">87</a>.&mdash;All of the spokes in place.</span>
</div>

<p>With the spokes lying in the position shown in diagram
(<a href="#Fig_87">Fig. 87</a>), take the eighth-inch weaver, and begin to weave
it in and out of the spokes. Start it under spoke No. 1
about two and one-half inches from the centre, bring it
over No. 9, under No. 5, over No. 10, under No. 3, over,
under, over, under, until it has crossed spoke No. 16; then
skip No. 1, bring the
weaver under No. 9,
and weave another
row. You will find
it necessary to skip
one spoke at the
beginning of each
row, in order to
make a continuous
under-and-over
weave. Weave five
rows with the
eighth-inch weaver,
then slide the end
under the last row,
lapping it an inch
or so and running
it under several
spokes, to hide the joint. Slip the first end under a spoke
also. During this part of the work your main endeavor
must be to weave in a perfect circle. The illustration
shows the bottom of the basket completed.</p>

<p>Before bending the spokes for the sides of the basket,
let them soak in the
water a few minutes,
then place the work
on the lap-board,
the same side up as
when started, and
carefully bend the
spokes up at right-angles
with the bottom
(<a href="#Fig_88">Fig. 88</a>). Start
a half-inch weaver
inside the basket,
close to the bottom,
and weave under
and over until the
row is complete;
then, allowing for a
lap of about three inches, cut the weaver off and slide the
end under the first end of the weaver, making the invisible
joint by tucking each end
under a spoke. Start the next
row a little beyond the joint
of the first row, that the joining
may not all come in one
place. Weave five rows of the
half-inch weaver, then two
rows of the fourth-inch weaver
and then bind off (<a href="#Fig_89">Fig. 89</a>).</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. <a id="Fig_88">88</a>.&mdash;Bend the spokes up.</span>
</div>


<div class='sectiontitle'>Binding Off</div>

<p>Cut the spokes off evenly,
leaving about two inches extending
above the top of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a><br /><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
basket, then put the basket in the water, spokes down,
and soak until pliable. Bend each spoke down snugly over
the top weaver, and
slip the end through
the next weaver,
pushing it down
until its end is hidden
under one of
the weavers. Bend
one spoke inside,
the next outside the
basket, according as
they come inside or
outside of the top
weaver (<a href="#Fig_89">Fig. 89</a>).</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. <a id="Fig_89">89</a>.&mdash;Binding off.</span>
</div>

<p>This binding off holds the top weaver in place and
makes the basket very firm; but the spokes must be protected
from wear where they are bent, and it is necessary
to put a double band
around the edge.
For this band cut
two pieces of the
fourth-inch weaver
which will go
around the basket
and lap about an
inch. Place one
piece along the inside edge, the other along the outside
edge of the basket, and with the sixteenth-inch weaver
bind them to the top weaver, as shown in Diagram 90.
Fasten the end by taking several cross-stitches with the
narrow weaver, passing it under the inside band only, and
tucking the end under the same band.</p>

<div class='sectiontitle'>The Trimming</div>

<p>Many splint baskets are trimmed with twisted loops of
the same material. For this trimming take one of the half-inch
weavers and cut a thread's width off its edge, making
it just a trifle narrower than the other weaver. Insert the
end of this weaver under a spoke at the top of the basket
(letter A, Diagram 91), give a twist to the left, and pass it
beneath the next spoke, as shown in Diagram 91, letter B.
Pull the loop down and flatten it a little with your thumb,
then twist the weaver again, this time to the right, and slip
the end under the next spoke, letter C. Continue this
around the basket, and make the joint of the trimming as
you did the other
joints, by lapping
the ends and slipping
them under
the spokes, which
makes the last loop
of double thickness.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 273px;">
<img src="images/i_092.png" width="273" height="158" alt="drawing" />
<span class="caption">Fig. <a id="Fig_91">91</a>.&mdash;Making the trimming.</span>
</div>

<p>The small basket
shown in the illustration
has two rows
of trimming, and between them is run a weaver of another
color pulled out into loops at the sides.</p>

<p>The illustration on the first page of this chapter shows
a large basket with four rows of trimming and handles.
The handles are made of the fourth-inch weaver, which is
brought around twice, making a ring of double thickness.
The ring is then wrapped with the eighth-inch weaver, and
fastened to the basket with loops of the same. The weaving
of this large basket differs from the smaller one, in that
the weaver is not cut at the end of each row, but is continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
around row after row. For a large basket the half-inch
weaver can be used in this way, but in a small basket
the slant of the weaver as it runs around is too apparent.
If a long weaver is used in a small basket it must not be
more than one-eighth of an inch in width.</p>

<p>While baskets of the natural white splint are extremely
dainty, color certainly gives variety and adds interest to
the work, and the splints will take dye readily. You might
also line your basket with silk of a color to harmonize with
the splint.</p>

<p>The white-ash splint one and one-half inches wide comes
in rolls of twenty-five yards, and a roll will make several
medium-sized baskets. The material may be obtained of
almost any kindergarten supply firm.</p>

<p>Cut a square of the same kind of tissue paper, measuring
nine and one-half inches on all four sides; fold diagonally
twice across the square as when making a paper pin-wheel.
The centre of the square is exactly where the
diagonal lines meet and cross; pinch the centre portion up
into a beak and tie it with a string (<a href="#Fig_101">Fig. 101</a>); then fit the
beak over the centre of the chicken's head, bringing the
paper entirely over the head on all sides; tie the square
around the chicken's neck close up to the head (<a href="#Fig_102">Fig. 102</a>).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a><br /><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
The two points A
and B of the square
must form the wings,
while C is carried
backward over the
under portion of the
body and D back
over the upper part,
the two ends C and
D being brought
together and tied tight
up to the body to form
the tail. In <a href="#Fig_103">Fig. 103</a> you
will see exactly how to
pinch up the wing if you
notice particularly the
upper part of the wing
B, next to the body. The
wing A on <a href="#Fig_103">Fig. 103</a> shows
how the two wings must
be tied close to, but not
on, the body. When each
wing is tied, make the
tail of C and D by tying
the extensions together
as explained above; that
done, bend down the legs,
spread out the wings and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
tail, open out and flatten the feet, then stand the little
chicken on a level surface (<a href="#Fig_104">Fig. 104</a>). Remember always
to crease the tissue-paper
with the grain of
the paper; if you attempt
to cross the grain
the paper will be very
apt to tear.</p>

<p>(<a href="#Fig_105">Fig. 105</a>) is also modelled
from half a sheet
of tissue-paper as near
the general color of a
turkey as can be found.
Make <a href="#Fig_92">Fig. 92</a> and <a href="#Fig_93">Fig. 93</a> of the paper; then
fold <a href="#Fig_93">Fig. 93</a> five and

from one end (<a href="#Fig_106">Fig. 106</a>, F).
Three inches from

the strips back and tie a string through the lower loop
up over the loose top layer (<a href="#Fig_106">Fig. 106</a>, H). Wind the extreme

the beak (<a href="#Fig_107">Fig. 107</a>), bend the beak down and tie it to
the neck to form the top of the head (<a href="#Fig_108">Fig. 108</a>, P). Make
the legs and feet as you did
those for the chicken (<a href="#Fig_98">Fig. 98</a>)
and slide them through the body
so that one fold of the body will
be above and
two beneath
the legs (<a href="#Fig_107">Fig. 107</a>). Cut
the wings
from a separate piece of tissue-paper
(<a href="#Fig_109">Fig. 109</a>). Let the paper
measure seven inches on the
widest side, five on the opposite
side, and four and one-half on
each of the other sides. Pinch the paper together through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the centre and tie (<a href="#Fig_110">Fig. 110</a>). Gather up one wing, so that it
will not tear, and slip it through the body, immediately over
the legs, with the widest side toward the front (<a href="#Fig_105">Fig. 105</a>),
leaving the other wing out free on the other side of the turkey.
Bend down the legs, spread the tail out fan shape
and bend it up; open out the wings and drop them downward
and forward (<a href="#Fig_105">Fig. 105</a>). Flatten out the feet and
stand up the turkey (<a href="#Fig_105">Fig. 105</a>).</p>

<div class='sectiontitle'>The Elephant</div>

<p>(<a href="#Fig_111">Fig. 111</a>) will require two sheets of brown tissue-paper for
its body, head, and trunk, which are all made of a single
strip of paper. Unfold, spread out and fit the two sheets of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
tissue-paper together; then gather up one side, as in <a href="#Fig_92">Fig. 92</a>, crease and gather up the other side (<a href="#Fig_93">Fig. 93</a>). Bind one
end with black thread to the distance of four and one-half
inches to form the trunk; then fold the remainder of the
strip into four layers, beginning with the free end of the
paper; fold over and over three times. This gives the body
and head. Bind black thread around the folds next to the
trunk to form the head. Make four legs of two pieces of
paper in the same way you formed those of the chicken
(<a href="#Fig_98">Fig. 98</a>), only the elephant's legs must be very much
thicker. Slide the legs through the body between the two
layers of paper, shove the front legs forward and the hind
legs backward. For the tail use a small strip of the brown
tissue-paper. Wrap it around and around with black thread
to within an inch of the bottom and cut this end up into
fringe. Fasten the tail on the elephant with black thread,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
pass the thread between the first and second layers of paper
forming the back of the body of the animal and tie the tail
on the outside threads which cross from side to side of the
elephant; bend the top of the tail over the thread, as you
would hang a garment on a clothes-line, and tie the bent-over
end down on to the tail proper. Shape the ears like
<a href="#Fig_112">Fig. 112</a>, pinch together the end S and tuck it under the
thread which separates the head from the
body. Allow the long side, M, to form the
front of the ears. You can add white ivory
tusks if desired. Roll up two white writing-paper
lighters and push an end of each
up in the head under the trunk, forming
one tusk on each side.</p>

</div>

<p>In making these little creatures do not
forget that you must do some modelling,
bending and shaping them with your fingers,
squeezing up the paper where it stands out
too far, and gently pulling it out in places
where it flattens too much. The heads can be turned to
suit the fancy, the bodies inclined this or that way, or they
may stand stiff and erect. You might model a number of
chickens, of different-colored paper, some yellow, some
white, and others black, like real chickens; or make several
turkeys and two or three elephants, some of the latter with
tusks and others without. The toys when finished will
cause exclamations of delight and approval. They are
simple and easy to put together, something which will not
cost much and yet be worth many times the amount expended
for the necessary material to manufacture. The
little animals are attractive, substantial toys, entirely
different from the common ones which any girl or boy
with sufficient pocket money may purchase.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

pair of scissors, a spool of thread, and
nimble fingers are all you need.</div>

<p>There are no patterns, only circles
and squares and strips of paper
which you gather here, spread out
there, wrap and tie some place else
and, with deft fingers, model into
almost exact reproductions of the
natural flower before you.</p>

<p>With its unfamiliar terms to be
committed to memory and the many parts of the flower
to be distinguished, botany is apt to prove dry and tiresome
to the little child, but to study nature by copying
the flowers in this marvellously adaptable material is only
a beautiful game which every child, and indeed many
grown people, will delight in. The form of the flower,
its name and color, may, by this means, be indelibly stamped
upon the memory, and a good foundation laid for further
study.</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>The Best Models</div>

<p>Ordinary garden flowers and those most easily procured
make the best models. The carnation-pink, the morning-glory,
and the rarer blossoms of the hibiscus, are well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
adapted to the work, also the daffodil and some of the wonderful
orchids.</p>

<p>Even holly with its sharp-spiked leaves and scarlet berries
and the white-berried, pale-green mistletoe may be
closely copied. All these and many more are made on the
same principle and in so simple a manner even quite a little
child may succeed
in producing very good
copies from Nature.</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>Material</div>

<p>Buy a sheet of light
pink tissue-paper, another
of darker pink, and one
of the darkest red you
can find. Then a sheet
of light yellow-green and
one of dark green. Have
a table "cleared for action"
and place your
paper on the right-hand
side, adding a pair of
scissors and a spool of
coarse thread, or, better
still, of soft darning-cotton.</p>



<p>With all this you are to copy the</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>Carnation-pink</div>

<div class='unindent'>which someone has given you or you have growing in your
own garden. Make one of your light pink paper, one of
the darker pink, and another of the rich, deep red to have
a variety.</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>Lay your natural flower down on the left-hand side of
the table, away from your material but quite within easy
reach, for it must be consulted
frequently. Seat
yourself comfortably and
don't work hurriedly.</p>

<p>The first thing necessary

know</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>How to Cut a Circle
Quickly,</div>

<div class='unindent'>easily and accurately, and
always without a pattern.
Here is a method which
never fails:</div>

<div class="figright" style="width: 221px;">
<img src="images/i_107b.png" width="221" height="224" alt="drawing" />
<span class="caption">Fig. <a id="Fig_114">114</a>.&mdash;The first triangle.</span>
</div>

<p>Cut a square the size you wish to make your circle.
That is, if you want a circle with a diameter of four inches
cut a four-inch square (<a href="#Fig_113">Fig. 113</a>). Fold the square diagonally
through the centre
according to the dotted
line on <a href="#Fig_113">Fig. 113</a>, and you
have the triangle (<a href="#Fig_114">Fig. 114</a>).
Fold this at the dotted
line and it will make
another triangle (<a href="#Fig_115">Fig. 115</a>).
Again fold through the
middle and you have the
third triangle (<a href="#Fig_116">Fig. 116</a>).
Fold once more and <a href="#Fig_117">Fig. 117</a> is the result. Measure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
the distance from the edge, B, to the centre A in <a href="#Fig_117">Fig. 117</a>
and mark the same distance on the other side of the angle
shown by the dot, C (<a href="#Fig_117">Fig. 117</a>). With your scissors cut
across from C to B, curving the edge slightly, as shown by
the dotted line from C to B (<a href="#Fig_118">Fig. 118</a>). <a href="#Fig_119">Fig. 119</a> is the circle
still in its folds. <a href="#Fig_120">Fig. 120</a> is the circle opened, the dotted
lines indicating where it has been folded.</p>

turn them into circles (<a href="#Fig_121">Fig. 121</a>) by the method just explained.
Take one of the circles at the centre, where the
folding lines cross, with the tips of the fingers of your left
hand and pinch it together; then, while still holding
it, crimp the edge with the fingers of your right
hand (<a href="#Fig_122">Fig. 122</a>). Do this always with every kind of
flower, whether it is made of
circles or squares. Without
loosening your hold of the
centre, draw the paper lightly
through your right hand several
times, then crimp the
edge again, this time with
the blade of your scissors.
Treat all the circles alike,
then place a small circle inside
a larger one and draw
them through your hand to
bring them together, pinching
them closely until within
a little over an inch of the
edge (<a href="#Fig_123">Fig. 123</a>). Make a slender
lighter of ordinary writing-paper
(<a href="#Fig_124">Fig. 124</a>), snip off
the point of the flower (D,
<a href="#Fig_123">Fig. 123</a>), open the other end
a little and push the lighter
through until its head is hidden.
This forms the stem.
Wrap and tie with thread at
the bottom of the flower (<a href="#Fig_125">Fig. 125</a>), and again where the petals spread. This last is
to be but temporary, as you will remove the thread when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>

not take the proper shape at first, model it with your fingers

<p>It is wonderful how
very natural these blossoms
appear. At a short
distance no one would think they are not the real, old
and familiar pinks. Only the fragrance is missing, and
that may also be supplied and a spicy odor
given by enclosing a whole clove in the heart
of each flower.</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>The Morning-Glory</div>

<p>From your pale-pink paper you can make
the delicately beautiful morning-glory. Have
the natural flower with its stem and leaves to
copy from, even if the blossom is not the color
you want. As with the pink, it is the general
form and appearance we strive for in the morning-glory,
not the detail.</p>

Crimp this in your fingers

it in your left hand and flatten

See that the fulness is evenly

straighten out the edges until

<p>Match the tint of your natural daffodil
in yellow tissue-paper as nearly as
possible, and then cut two squares for
each flower measuring about five and
one-half inches. Fold the squares crosswise
and diagonally through the centre
as you did for the calyx of the morning-glory
(<a href="#Fig_134">Fig. 134</a>), and cut one square in
half along one of its diagonal folds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>

square two and a quarter
inches below each corner
and tie as in <a href="#Fig_137">Fig. 137</a>, but
do not twist the points.
This gives you four petals,
but as the daffodil has
six, you must make two
more from the triangular
halves of the square
you have just cut. Gather
each triangle across from side to side, according
to the dotted line in <a href="#Fig_141">Fig. 141</a>, and
pinch and tie in place as in <a href="#Fig_142">Fig. 142</a>, making
sure the petal is of exactly the same
size as those on the square. Bring together
the fan of paper left below the
petal and wrap and tie as in <a href="#Fig_143">Fig. 143</a>,
then cut off the ragged end (<a href="#Fig_144">Fig. 144</a>).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Draw the petals of the square together as you did the calyx,

<p>Turn back to the bud of

a circle of the yellow paper,
with a diameter of four inches,
make the cup (<a href="#Fig_131">Fig. 131</a>), using
the scissors to give a fine crimp
to the edges. Pinch the cup
together at the bottom almost
half-way up and tie (<a href="#Fig_146">Fig. 146</a>);
slip it on your finger like a
thimble and press it into
shape like <a href="#Fig_147">Fig. 147</a>. Insert

<p>Cut a two and three-quarter-inch square from light-brown
paper and divide it diagonally in half for the calyx.
Examine your natural daffodil and notice how loosely the
calyx seems to be wrapped around the flower. Imitate this
by leaving the point loose at the top, while you wrap the
bottom of the calyx closely around the stem. Allow the
wrapping for the stem to cover the lower part of the brown
calyx. Make several long, narrow leaves from strips of
dark-green paper, two inches wide and of varying lengths.
Twist one end of each leaf into a point and, gathering the
other end, draw it through your hands until it stands up
stiffly. Wrap each leaf partly around the stem and tie in
place, following as closely as possible the natural growth of
the leaf on the stem. Bend the stem just below each flower,
being careful not to break the paper lighter which forms it.</p>

<p>If you use thread the color of the flowers for tying and
green for the stems the effect will be almost perfect.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

A wigwam, camp-fire, Indian travois, blanket-weaving

cover one side and the four edges of the board with a piece
of light-green cotton flannel stretched tight, fleece side up,
and tacked to the under side of the board. Sprinkle sand
and small stones on the grass at one side of the wigwam, to
show where the grass has been worn off by the tramping of
the Indians, the bronco pony, and the dog, for all Indians
possess dogs of some description. If you have a toy dog of
suitable size, stand him by the fire where he will be comfortable.
Before the red men owned horses, a dog was always
used to drag the travois, and to this day the braves
care as much for a dog as does any pale-faced boy&mdash;which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>

grass near one end of the ground. Fold a strip of paper
lengthwise, stick a pin
through one end of the paper
and drive it down into the
board where you wish the
centre of the circle, push the
point of a lead pencil
through the other end of
the paper four inches from
the pin; keep the pin steady
while you move the pencil around many times until a
circle appears plainly on the grass (<a href="#Fig_167">Fig. 167</a>).</div>

<span class="caption">Fig. <a id="Fig_168">168</a>.&mdash;Pole sharpened to flat point.</span>
</div>

<p>Cut twelve slender sticks eleven inches long and sharpen
the heavy end of each into a flat point (<a href="#Fig_168">Fig. 168</a>). The sticks
must be straight, for they are wigwam-poles. Tie three
poles together two inches
from their tops and spread
out the sharpened ends at
nearly equal distances apart
on the circle line; mark the spots where they rest and bore
gimlet-holes in each place through the cloth into the wood.
Enlarge each hole with a penknife and insert the poles, pushing
the sharpened points down firmly into the holes (<a href="#Fig_169">Fig. 169</a>). Add seven more poles around the circle, keeping the
spaces between all about even. Sink these last poles in the
ground as you did the first three; then tie the tops together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
around the first three poles,
and you will have the wigwam
framework of ten
poles standing strong and
firm.</p>

half circle, then an inch and a half from the spot A (<a href="#Fig_170">Fig. 170</a>), where the pin is stationed, begin to cut the opening
for the top of the wigwam poles, B (<a href="#Fig_170">Fig. 170</a>). Slash the
point C in as far as D, sew pieces of cloth over the points
E and E, leaving the opening at dotted lines to form pockets
for the smoke-poles. Cut two rows of little holes on each
side of the upper part of the wigwam to run the pinsticks
through when fastening the wigwam together (<a href="#Fig_171">Fig. 171</a>).</p>

<p>Now comes the fun of decorating the cover. Pin the
cloth out flat and smooth, and paint in brilliant red, yellow,
black, green, white, and blue the designs given in <a href="#Fig_170">Fig. 170</a>.
When finished, fit the cover over the wigwam-poles and
with short, slender sticks pin the fronts together. Peg the
lower edge down to the ground with short black pins and
slide a pole in each pocket of the smoke-flaps E and E (<a href="#Fig_170">Fig. 170</a>). Bring the poles around and cross them at the back of
the wigwam. As you do this you will exclaim with delight
at the result, for the little wigwam will be very realistic.</p>

end of the pole to keep it firm. Suspend an acorn kettle or
any little kettle of the right size for the Indians to use on the
pole and the camp will begin to look cosey for the red men
to enjoy. Hunt up a jointed doll about five inches high,

<p>If you can find a Zulu doll of the required size, with long,
straight black hair, and give him a wash of dull red paint,
you can turn him into a fine Indian. Failing these dolls,
make an Indian doll of dull red raffia or cloth. This you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
can do if you try, and remember to have your red man a little
more slender than store dolls; most of these are rather
too stout to make good Indians.</p>

<p>Real chiefs like Turning Eagle, Swift Dog, Crazy Bull,
and others, wore gorgeous
feather headdresses,
and gloried in
the strange war bonnets,
not because they were
gay and startling, but
for the reason that each
separate feather in the
head-band meant that the owner had performed
a brave deed of which the tribe was
proud, and the greater the number of brave
deeds the greater the number of feathers;
consequently the longer the bonnet-trail. This
explains the real meaning of the common expression,
"A feather in your cap."</p>

the paper eagle feathers red, the tops of the
feathers black, and the band in which they
are fastened yellow, red, and green, leaving
white spaces between the colors (<a href="#Fig_173">Fig. 173</a>).
Cut out, then turn the end of the band F
(<a href="#Fig_172">Fig. 172</a>) until the loop fits the Indian's head,
and glue the end of the loop on the strip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
(<a href="#Fig_173">Fig. 173</a>). Paste fringed
yellow paper around each of
the chieftain's feet, fringed
edge uppermost, to serve
as moccasins. Part the
Indian's hair at the back,
bring the two divisions in
front, one on each side of
the head, and wind each
with scarlet worsted as the
real Indian wears his hair,
then wrap around your red man a soft, dull-colored
cloth extending

the two long poles four inches from their heavy ends; fasten
the five-and-a-half-inch pole across the long poles two
and one-half inches above the first cross-piece. Instead of
thongs of buffalo hide, such as the real red man would use,
take narrow strips of light-brown cloth to form the rude
net-work over the space bounded by the four poles. Tie
the top ends of the long poles together (<a href="#Fig_174">Fig. 174</a>), then tie
the travois to the horse, as in <a href="#Fig_175">Fig. 175</a>. In most of these

short pole to short pole, forming a ladder-like arrangement.</p>

<div class='sectiontitle'>Calumet,</div>

<div class='unindent'>or "pipe of peace," to smoke and pass around the council
circle, when all the leaders of the different tribes meet to
talk over important matters concerning
the welfare of their people. Real calumets
are generally large and of goodly
length, some of them being four feet long.
They are made of dull-red stone, which,
when first cut from the large mass, is soft
enough to be carved out with a knife; later the pipe becomes
hard and capable of receiving a polish. But as
the red stone is not within our reach, we must use dull red-colored
straw for the calumet. Soak the straw in hot water
to render it less brittle. Then cut a three-inch length
piece; make a hole in it a short distance from one end (<a href="#Fig_176">Fig. 176</a>, G) and insert a three-quarter inch length of straw for
the pipe bowl (<a href="#Fig_176">Fig. 176</a>, H). For the mouthpiece take a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
half-inch length of white straw (<a href="#Fig_176">Fig. 176</a>, I), and slide it in
the other end of the pipe. Glue both bowl and mouthpiece
in place and decorate the calumet with red, green,
and white silk floss tied on the pipe stem (<a href="#Fig_177">Fig. 177</a>).</div>


<div class='sectiontitle'>The Tomahawk</div>

<div class='unindent'>must not be forgotten. Soak a stick two
and one-half inches long in
hot water; when it is pliable,
split an end down one inch, no
more (<a href="#Fig_178">Fig. 178</a>, J), and in true
Indian fashion bind a stone
hatchet (<a href="#Fig_178">Fig. 178</a>, K) between
the split sides of the stick
handle with thongs of hide.
Whittle the little hatchet from
a piece of wood, cover it with
glue, then with sand. When
dry it will be difficult for
others to believe that the implement
is not of real stone.
Instead of thongs use thread

<div class='unindent'>is of hide taken from the neck

size for a finished shield to allow for the necessary shrinkage.
Over a fire built in a hole in the ground the skin is
stretched and pegged down. When heated, it is covered
with a strong glue made from the hoofs and joints of the
bison, which causes the hide to contract and thicken. As
this process goes on the pegs are loosened and again adjusted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
until the skin ceases to contract and absorb the glue.
Then the hide is much smaller and thicker than at first.
When it has slowly cooled, the skin is cut into a circle and
decorated. Though pliable, the shield is strong enough to
ward off blows from arrows or spears.</div>

green for the grass, yellow for the sun, white for the
clouds and snow, and black. To the Indian color is a part
of religion. Purple, pinks, and some other colors, the red
man, loyal to his beliefs, can never bring himself to use.
Attach two of the remaining feathers at the top and another

flint arrow-head.</span>
</div>

<p>The Indian makes his</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>Arrow-heads</div>

<div class='unindent'>of triangular flakes of flint chipped from a stone held between
his knees and struck with a rude stone hammer.
The pieces knocked off are carefully examined, and only
those without flaws are kept. Stones for arrow-heads must
be very hard. When found, the red men bury them in wet
ground and build fires over them, causing the stones to
show all cracks and checks. This enables the
arrow-maker to discard those unfitted for his
work.</div>



<p>Though you cannot make a real flint arrow-head,
you can manufacture a toy one. Take
a piece of stiff pasteboard and cut it like <a href="#Fig_183">Fig. 183</a>. Let the length be a trifle over half an
inch. Cover the arrow-head all over with a
light coat of glue, then dip it in sand, and the
arrow-head will come out as if made of stone. Were it
actually hard stone and large size you would be obliged,
as the Indians do, to trim and shape more perfectly the
point and edges of the arrow-head. You would hold a pad
of buckskin in your left hand to protect it from the sharp
flint, and on your right hand would be a piece of dressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
hide to guard it from the straight piece of bone, pointed
on the end, which you would use to strike off little bits of
stone along both edges, working cautiously
as you neared the point in order
not to break it. But such
work will not be needed on
your arrow-head.</p>

in length, remove the bark

about the thickness of an ordinary
match. Notch one end and
split the other end down one-quarter
of an inch, insert the
arrow-head (<a href="#Fig_184">Fig. 184</a>), then bind
the shaft and head together with thread (<a href="#Fig_185">Fig. 185</a>), in place
of the wet sinew an Indian would use for a real arrow, after
he had first fastened the head in the shaft with
glue from buffalo hoofs.</div>

<p>It is made of shells found usually along the borders of

shell into cylinders about an inch long, bore holes lengthwise
through the centres and string them like
beads on fine, strong sinews (<a href="#Fig_201">Fig. 201</a>), but this
money is not as pretty as glass beads, for it
resembles pieces of common clay pipe stems.
A certain number of hand-breadths of wampum
will buy a gun, a skin, a robe, or a horse, and
when presented by one chief to another the
wampum means good-will and peace. Of course,
you will want to supply your Indians

eagle claws, bright beads, and tufts

as near as possible in color and form

tiny eagle claws made of wood cut
like <a href="#Fig_202">Fig. 202</a>, only smaller. Paint the claws very dark
gray, almost black, and bore a hole through the heavy end

cut the logs which were for the big kitchen fireplace. And
such a fireplace! Large enough for the huge, roaring
fire and the chimney-seats also. These were placed close
against the sides of the opening, making fine places for the
boys and girls to sit and listen to thrilling tales of adventure
or delightful fairy stories.</div>

<p>The kitchen in those days was the chief apartment and
the most interesting room in the house. Who would want
to go into the stiff, prim "best room" when they could be
so much more comfortable in the spacious kitchen where
everyone was busy and happy, and where apples could be
hung by a string in front of the fire to roast and made to
spin cheerily when the string was twisted, that all sides
might be equally heated? Any girl or boy to-day would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a><br /><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
only too glad of a chance to sit on a log in front of such a
fire and watch red apples turn and sputter as the heat broke
the apple skin, setting free the luscious juice to trickle down
the sides.</p>

<p>As the Indian's first thought was for shelter, and he put
up his wigwam, so the early settler's first thought was for
shelter, and he built, not a wigwam, but a log-house with a
kitchen large enough to serve as a general utility room. It
was filled with various things, and all articles in it were used
constantly. Everything not brought from the mother
country the settlers made by hand. The colonial kitchen
you can build may be of gray or white cardboard. Old
boxes, if large enough, will answer the purpose.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. <a id="Fig_205">205</a>.&mdash;Kitchen floor.</span>
</div>

<p>I will tell you exactly how I built the colonial kitchen
seen in <a href="#Fig_204">Fig. 204</a>. I made the floor (<a href="#Fig_205">Fig. 205</a>), the two side
walls both alike (<a href="#Fig_206">Fig. 206</a>), the back wall (<a href="#Fig_207">Fig. 207</a>), and the
interior of the fireplace (<a href="#Fig_208">Fig. 208</a>) of light-gray cardboard.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
I cut all the heavy
lines, scored and
then bent all the
dotted lines.</p>

<p>Now you do
the same thing.
Get your measurements
correct
and be careful to
make the lines
perfectly straight.
Before putting
the kitchen together,
fasten the rustic brackets, cut from a branching
twig (<a href="#Fig_209">Fig. 209</a>), on the wall above the mantel-piece to support<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>

wall around each twig, as shown in <a href="#Fig_210">Fig. 210</a>, at the dots
A and A and B and B (<a href="#Fig_207">Fig. 207</a>).</p>

<p>Every colonial fireplace boasted of</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>A Strong Crane</div>

<div class='unindent'>upon which to hang the pots and kettles over the fire.
One end of the crane was bent down and attached to the

crane to turn so that the extending iron rod could be swung
forward to receive the hanging cooking utensils and then
pushed back, carrying the pot and
kettles over the fire for the contents
to cook. The crane was black
and of iron. A hair-pin (<a href="#Fig_211">Fig. 211</a>)
makes a fine crane. Bend yours,
as shown in <a href="#Fig_212">Fig. 212</a>, then with two
socket-rings made with stitches
of black darning-cotton fasten the
crane to the side of the chimney at
the dots C and C (<a href="#Fig_207">Fig. 207</a>), and tie
a piece of the darning-cotton on the
little crane immediately below the
lower socket-ring; bring the thread diagonally across to
the top arm of the crane an inch and a quarter from the
free end and again tie it securely (<a href="#Fig_213">Fig. 213</a>).</div>

lines and the little holes; score, then bend the
dotted lines. Bend down the long sides and the
ends fitting the corners against
and on the inside of the same
letters on the sides, glue these
in place and you have a long,
narrow box with two extensions
on one side (HH and GG).
Bend these extensions, also
their ends II and JJ, and glue
the ends on the inside of the
opposite side of the box against
the places marked II and JJ.</p>

<p>Turn the box over, bringing
the level smooth side uppermost.
Cut out the wheel
brace (<a href="#Fig_233">Fig. 233</a>), turn it over on

backward and BB forward,

squares AA and BB. See <a href="#Fig_228">Fig. 228</a>.</p>

the wheels above the wood
that the flat end of the upright<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>

bore the hole LL through the front of

MM, through the side. Make the screw

one end of the stand (<a href="#Fig_232">Fig. 232</a>) and pass it down through
the under hole on HH. The lower part of the upright
forms the third leg. See that all
three legs set evenly when
the wheel stands, and that
the box part is raised slightly
higher at the upright end, slanting downward
toward the other end (<a href="#Fig_228">Fig. 228</a>). Glue the three
legs firmly in place.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

large wheel, fastening it on here and
there with a little glue (<a href="#Fig_228">Fig. 228</a>).
Twist a piece of raw cotton on the

darning-cotton to the end of the cotton

the gun (<a href="#Fig_251">Fig. 251</a>) of stiff cardboard.
Break a piece measuring
four and one-half inches from a
common coarse steel knitting-needle for your gun-barrel

(<a href="#Fig_256">Fig. 256</a>), and attach the free ends of the
folded strips to the other piece of pasteboard
bellows, forming a hinge-like connection on
each side between the two pasteboard sides.
Paste the points of the two sides together
up as far as the dotted line (<a href="#Fig_256">Fig. 256</a>). When
thoroughly dry you can work the bellows by
bringing the handles together and opening

out round, flat pieces and holding
one at a time in the palm of
your left hand, round up the
edges by rolling the ball of a
hat-pin around and around the plate; press rather hard and
soon the edges will begin to crinkle and turn upward (<a href="#Fig_258">Fig. 258</a>). You may mould some deeper than others and have a

in the big oven,
and the bread
might burn. Cut
<a href="#Fig_262">Fig. 262</a> of cardboard
and score all
dotted lines, except
NN-OO, which
forms the hinge of
the door. Mark
this with a pinhole
at top and bottom,
turn the cardboard
over and draw a line from pinhole to pinhole; then
score it on this line that the door may open properly outward.
Try to draw the face of the clock correctly. Make
it in pencil first so that any mistake may be erased and corrected.
When you have the face drawn as it should be, go
over the pencil lines with pen and ink. Begin the face
with a circle (<a href="#Fig_263">Fig. 263</a>). Make it as you made the circle for
the wigwam, only, of course, very much smaller. Above
the circle, at the distance of half the diameter of the circle,
draw a curve with your home-made compass (<a href="#Fig_264">Fig. 264</a>).
Lengthen the compass a little and make another curve a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
trifle above the first (<a href="#Fig_265">Fig. 265</a>). Connect the lower curve
with the circle by two straight lines (<a href="#Fig_266">Fig. 266</a>), draw a small
circle above the large one (<a href="#Fig_267">Fig. 267</a>), connect the two circles
by two scallops (<a href="#Fig_268">Fig. 268</a>), and bring the upper curve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
down into a square (<a href="#Fig_269">Fig. 269</a>). The small top circle stands
for the moon; draw a simple face on it like <a href="#Fig_270">Fig. 270</a>, then
make the numbers on the large circle
(<a href="#Fig_271">Fig. 271</a>) and also the hands (<a href="#Fig_272">Fig. 272</a>).
Both numbers and hands must be on the
same circle on the clock. They are on
two different circles in the diagrams that
you may see exactly how to draw them.</div>

across the top on the outside,

<p>Cut <a href="#Fig_274">Fig. 274</a> of heavy paper or light-weight cardboard;
mark three bands on it (<a href="#Fig_275">Fig. 275</a>).
Make your churn much larger than
pattern, have it deep enough to stand
as high as <a href="#Fig_275">Fig. 275</a>. Glue the sides
together along the dotted lines, turn
up the circular bottom and glue the extensions up
around the bottom of the churn. Fit a cork in the
top for the churn-lid and make a hole through the centre of
the cork for the handle of the dasher (<a href="#Fig_276">Fig. 276</a>). Make the
handle by rolling up a strip of paper as you would roll a
paper lighter. Glue the loose top end of the handle on its
roll; then cut the large end of the handle up a short distance
through its centre (<a href="#Fig_277">Fig. 277</a>). Cut the dasher (<a href="#Fig_278">Fig. 278</a>) from cardboard, slide it over
the divided end of handle (<a href="#Fig_279">Fig. 279</a>),
bend the two halves of the handle-end
in opposite directions, and glue
them on the dasher as shown in
<a href="#Fig_280">Fig. 280</a>. Slip the handle of dasher
through the cork lid (<a href="#Fig_281">Fig. 281</a>), and
fit the lid in the churn (<a href="#Fig_275">Fig. 275</a>).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
Paint the churn and handle of dasher a light-yellow-brown
wood color, the bands black, and when dry you can work
the dasher up and down the same as if the churn were a
real one. Stand the churn in your kitchen not far from the
fire so that little Thankful may attend to the cooking while
she is churning.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>LITTLE PAPER HOUSES OF JAPAN</div>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_181.png" width="240" height="181" alt="F"/>
</div><div><br /></div><div class='drop-cap'>FRAGILE, quaint and full of sunshine
and color are the typical houses
of Japan. They are so simple
in construction a child might
almost build them, generally
only one story in height and
always without a cellar, chimneys,
fireplaces, windows, and
even without a door. Yet the dainty abodes are flooded
with light and fresh air. How is it managed? Simply by
sliding the entire front of the house to one side, leaving
the building wide open. Often the back walls, too, are
opened, and in some houses the sides also. These cottages
are usually part wood and part paper. It seems strange
to think of people actually living in paper dwellings, but
the Japanese understand how to manufacture strong,
durable paper. They delight in making all sorts of paper,
from the tough, well-nigh indestructible kind to the delicate,
filmy variety, and it is adapted to innumerable uses.
In Japan people not only build paper walls, but the very
poor wear paper clothing.</div>

</div>

<p>We will make our</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>Japanese House</div>

<div class='unindent'>entirely of paper (<a href="#Fig_282">Fig. 282</a>). Take medium-weight water-color
paper, or any kind that is stiff enough and not too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
brittle, cut a piece sixteen inches long and seventeen inches
wide and on it mark the plan of the large room (<a href="#Fig_283">Fig. 283</a>).
This should measure sixteen inches across the back from
A to A, seventeen inches along the side from A to B, and
thirteen inches across the front from B to C. The back
division forms the foliage and the back of the room, the
centre division the roof, and the front division the front and
sides of the room.</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 568px;">

<span class="caption">Fig. <a id="Fig_283">283</a>.&mdash;Plan of large room.</span>
</div>

<p>No paste is used in making the building; the design is
merely cut out, bent into shape, and fastened together with
projecting tongues run through slits. Cut all the heavy
lines, lightly score, then bend all the dotted lines, except
the two immediately across the front of the room at top and
bottom. This front is five inches wide and four and a half
inches high, with two openings in it and a portion extending
down in front to form the little porch. Make a pinhole at each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
end of the two lines forming top and bottom of the front of
the room A and B, then turn the paper over and draw a top
line and a bottom line across on the wrong side of the paper
from pin-point to pin-point. Score these on the wrong side
of the paper, for they must bend from that side in order to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
extend inward from the right side to form the projection
of the roof and the top landing of the veranda. Fasten the
room together, then cut out the floor (<a href="#Fig_284">Fig. 284</a>), slide it in
place and also the steps (<a href="#Fig_285">Fig. 285</a>), marking straight lines
across the diagram
to indicate
steps.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. <a id="Fig_284">284</a>.&mdash;Floor of large room.</span>
</div>

<p>Build the
small room (<a href="#Fig_286">Fig. 286</a>) in the same
way that you
made the large
one. Cut it
from a piece of
paper nine and one-half inches wide and thirteen and one-half
inches long. This room has no floor. When finished
run the tongues extending out on the back of the room
through the remaining four slits at the side of the foliage
on the back of the large room (<a href="#Fig_283">Fig. 283</a>). Work carefully and you will
be fully repaid.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. <a id="Fig_285">285</a>.&mdash;The steps.</span>
</div>

<p>Paint the roof of each room in
little black squares with white markings
between to represent black tiling.
Paint the outside of the house
yellow, the back wall of the large
room pale blue, the floor light brown. Paint the back of
the small room mottled green and pink. Make a band of
light blue edged with black across the outside top of the
front opening and a red band across the bottom. Let the
projecting veranda be yellow, with vines across the lower
part. Edge the openings of the large room with two narrow
bands, one purple the other black, and mark black lines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
from side to side crossed with lines running from top to
bottom to form a lattice-like work on the side of the smaller
opening (<a href="#Fig_282">Fig. 282</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 419px;">
<img src="images/i_185.png" width="419" height="617" alt="drawing" />
<span class="caption">Fig. <a id="Fig_286">286</a>.&mdash;Plan of small room.</span>
</div>

<p>The sides of the house are supposed to be formed of
paper-covered screens which slide in grooves and may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
removed entirely when desired. The interior of a real Japanese
house is divided into rooms merely by the use of
sliding paper screens, and the entire floor may readily be
thrown into one large apartment, there being no solid partitions
as in our houses. Cut out flat round paper lanterns,
paint them with the gayest of colors and make the small top
and bottom bands black; then with needle and thread fasten
the lanterns along the top front of the large opening of the
small room (<a href="#Fig_282">Fig. 282</a>).</p>

<p>You need not be concerned in the least about furnishing
the little house: it does not need any furniture, for the Japanese
have no stoves, chairs, tables, knives or forks, carpets,
bedsteads, washstands, bookcases, desks, framed pictures,
nor any comforts like ours.</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>The Floors</div>

<div class='unindent'>are covered with clean, thick, soft matting rugs and are just
the place for girls and boys to play, and have a good time
running about in their stocking feet, for in Japan people
always take off their shoes before entering a house and
everyone goes either stocking-footed or barefooted when
indoors, so the floor-mats are kept free from dust.</div>

<p>Of course, men, women, and children all sit on the floor;
and when</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>Breakfast is Ready</div>

<div class='unindent'>the floor is set instead of a table, and each person receives
his own little lacquer tray placed on the floor, or on a low
wooden stool, with the individual portion of rice in a delicate
china bowl, pale tea in dainty teacups and shredded
or diced raw fish in china a queen might envy. On the
tray are also a pair of ivory chopsticks, which even a little
child can manage skilfully, in place of the spoon, knife, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
fork that our girls or boys would use. The Japanese do not
have bread, butter, milk, or coffee, and never any meat, but
they cultivate a mammoth radish which is cut up, pickled
and eaten with relish. For dinner they take pale tea, rice,
and fish, and for supper fish, pale tea, and rice. Often the
fish is cooked, sweetmeats are served and pickled radish
also, but frequently the breakfast consists of merely a bowl
of cold rice. These unique people do not seem to think or
care much about their food; many times they deny themselves
a meal that they may spend the money on a feast of
flowers in some garden where they can enjoy gazing upon
masses of exquisite cherry blossoms, chrysanthemums, or
other flowers. No nation in the world loves flowers more
than the Japanese, and none can rival them in the beautiful
arrangement of their blossoms.</div>

<p>When night comes the natives</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>Never Go to Bed,</div>

<div class='unindent'>for there are no beds. Soft silk or cotton comforts are
brought to each person, and the people roll themselves up
in the comforts and sleep any place they wish on the floor,
using little wooden or lacquer benches for pillows; usually
these have a roll of soft paper on the top, making them a
little more comfortable. Take a comfort and try sleeping
on the floor with some books under your head and you will
know how it feels to sleep in Japanese style.</div>

<p>Every Japanese house should have its</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>Fenced-in Garden.</div>

<p>Make your fence of paper cut according to <a href="#Fig_287">Fig. 287</a>, and
mark the pattern (<a href="#Fig_288">Fig. 288</a>) on it with two tones of yellow
paint. Paint the convex top of the gate-way a bright red
with narrow black border, and mark the white gate-posts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
with black Japanese lettering like <a href="#Fig_289">Fig. 289</a>. Paint the remaining
portions of the gate-way yellow, the edges black.
<a href="#Fig_282">Fig. 282</a> will help you to grasp the idea of the fence and
gate-way. The names of the streets are not on the corners
as in our cities, so a panel of white wood is nailed to the
gate-posts with both the name of the street and householder
on it, and often a charm sign is added.</p>

<p>Put up the fence by slipping the upper tongues on each
end through the slit on the outside front edge of each room,
then sliding the lower
tongues of the fence
through the lower outside
edges of rooms
and porches (<a href="#Fig_282">Fig. 282</a>).</p>



<p>Both boys and girls
have fine times in
Japan, and they are as
happy as the day is
long. On the fifth day
of the fifth month the
boys reign supreme, and their relatives and friends vie with
each other in their endeavors to render the day a happy one
for the little fellows. All Japan is alive and anxious to
celebrate the occasion. Quaint flags in the shape of enormous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
fish swim in the air and float over
the towns, forming bright masses of color.
Every home that is blessed with one or
more boys displays a fish banner for each
son, the younger the child the larger the
fish, and the proudest house is the one that
can boast of the greatest number of fish
flying from its bamboo pole. Every Japanese
boy's birthday is celebrated on this day
with great rejoicing, no matter at what time
of the year he was born.</p>

high in air with their wide-open

then paste the hoop on the inside of

fish with red paint like <a href="#Fig_292">Fig. 292</a>. Tie a thread on the two

the loop to a slender stick on the
end of which you have fastened a
gold disk made of two pieces of gilt
paper. This is intended to represent
the rice ball with which the real
fish are fed. The fish
banners are hollow so
that the wind may fill
them, causing the fish
to rise and fall as
the breeze comes and
goes. Push the end
of your fish-pole
through the centre of
a small box-lid or button
mould (<a href="#Fig_293">Fig. 293</a>)

outside the
gate-way of the little
house. The fish used
on this eventful day
are the famous carp,
which the natives call

The Japanese
carp stands for good
cheer, indomitable
will, perseverance

dressed images, representing the Mikado, nobles, and ladies,
are brought out and placed on exhibition, along with beautiful
jars containing queer little trees and rare vases filled
with flowers. The day is made a joyous one and a day
long to be remembered by the little girls.</div>



<p>There are no sidewalks in Japan, the pavements being
laid lengthwise through the centre of the streets, and on
this path people stroll or hurry along. Mingled with the
others are the Japanese laboring men, called
coolies, carrying between them</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>The Kago,</div>

<a href="#Fig_294">Fig. 294</a> of stiff paper, make it three inches
long and at the broadest part an inch and a
quarter wide. Paint the <i lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">kago</i> yellow, and to
form the framework sew on each end a piece
of heavy broom straw, jointed grass, or straw
which has been limbered by soaking, and cut a piece six

procession, the beautiful decorations and the gay festivities
which always form part of the jubilant occasion.</div>

<p>For centuries the great white Czars have been crowned
in the</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>Cathedral of the Assumption,</div>

<div class='unindent'>which, though not large, is magnificent, and is the most important
building in all Russia. The structure stands, surrounded
by many other sacred edifices, in an enclosure
known as the Kremlin, situated in the centre of the city of
Moscow. Its white walls support a vaulted roof of soft,
dull green crowned with golden cupolas, each cupola surmounted
by a shining golden cross. The interior is resplendent
almost beyond description with its rich coloring,
its jewel-framed paintings, its sculptures, its gold, silver, and
precious stones, its priceless robes and holy relics.</div>

</div>

<p>To give a true conception of the wonderful interior of
the sacred cathedral to one who has never seen it, is impossible,
but we can gain an idea of the general appearance of
the exterior by making a miniature Cathedral of the Assumption<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
(<a href="#Fig_299">Fig. 299</a>). Find, or make, a firm white pasteboard
box seven inches long, five and one-quarter inches wide, and
four and one-half inches high; this is for the body of the
building. Fold a strip of paper seven inches in length,
crosswise, through the centre, and bring the ends together,
making another fold crosswise through the centre of the
doubled strip, which will give four layers of paper of equal
length. Cut this into a scallop three-quarters of an inch
deep, open out the strip and you will have four scallops,
each one and three-quarters inch wide, at its base. Lay the
strip in turn along each of the top edges of the sides of the
box, and mark the box around the edges of the scallops,
drawing four scallops on the two long sides of the box, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
three on each of the short sides.
Cut out the scallops on top of
the box; then take the cover of
the box, which must form the
roof of the structure, and remove
the bent-down sides; trim off
with scissors the extreme edge
of one long side and one short
side, until the cover forms a tight fit in the

<p>Make the trousers loose and bind them to the doll below

always reach up over the trousers, and you can make such
boots by painting the doll's feet black and sewing straight
pieces of black material on the doll for boot-legs, allowing
the cloth to be long enough to wrinkle around the ankle.</p>

<p>Try to make the boots appear as if laced up the front,
for many wear them so in Russia. The blouse should be
loose and belted in at the waist, hanging straight and square
around the bottom. In case your doll has real hair, omit
the wig and cut the real hair in Russian style.</p>

<p>These people never use their immense stove for heating
a teakettle, though they drink tea upon all occasions. To
make tea they resort to a samovar, which is a curious brass
or copper vessel, shaped something like an urn. When the
tea is ready, it is poured into tall glasses, a slice of lemon is
put in each glass, and the tea drunk scalding hot. The
beverage is called <i lang="ru" xml:lang="ru">chai</i>, and the Russians enjoy it so much
that they often take twenty glasses in succession. When
one desires sugar, it is not put in the tea, but held in one
hand, and a portion bitten off from time to time between
the swallows of tea.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>Make the top chimney of a roll of paper a generous inch
in width. Paste the loose edge of the paper down on the
roll, and pierce a hole in the roll one-quarter inch from the
bottom, making it large enough to admit the end of a match.
Glue a burned match in this hole, allowing the main part
to extend out one-quarter of an inch from the chimney.
Fasten a small, round, flat button on the end, and attach a
round paper disk three-quarters of an inch in diameter to
the top of the chimney, crowning the disk with the large
bead.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>POTTERY WITHOUT A POTTER'S WHEEL</div>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_204.png" width="304" height="172" alt="A"/>
</div><div><br /><br /><br /></div><div class='drop-cap'>ALMOST every girl at one
time in her life has loved
dearly to make mud-pies,
and it is not strange,
for her mother, grandmother,
and many, many
times great-great-grandmother
before her delighted
in making mud-pies. The last, the primitive women
of our race, made them to some purpose, for they were the
inventors of pottery. The home-making, house-keeping
instinct was strong even in these women, who had no
houses to keep, and they did their best with the material
at hand.</div>

<p>First they wove rude baskets for holding and carrying
food; then they learned that cooked food was better than
uncooked and could be preserved much longer, so they
made baskets of a closer weave and cooked in them by
means of water heated by hot stones; finally, they tried
cooking over the fire in shallow baskets lined with clay.
The clay came out of the basket baked and hard, and behold,
they had a new kind of vessel&mdash;fire-proof and water-proof.</p>

<p>We may imagine with what joy they welcomed this addition
to their meagre store of home-making utensils and
with what patient industry they strove to improve upon
this discovery.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 502px;">

<span class="caption">Making coiled pottery</span>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>They used their baskets as moulds to hold the soft clay,
and they fashioned the clay without moulds into shapes
suggested by natural objects. The sea-shells furnished inspiration
and many vessels were made in their beautiful
forms.</p>

<p>The first potter was a woman, even as the first basket-maker
was a woman, and, coming down to our own times,
the important discovery of the production of exquisite colors
and blending of colors in the Rookwood pottery was
made by a woman.</p>

<p>Discovered, developed, and still, in many cases, carried
on by women, surely pottery is a woman's art, and as a girl
inheriting the old instincts, you may find it the simplest
and most natural means of expressing your individuality
and love of the beautiful. Beginning as these gentle savages
began, using their primitive method, you may be inspired
to study deeper into the art, and perhaps become
the discoverer of some new process that will give to the
world a still more beautiful pottery.</p>

<p>Even the smallest girls may do something in</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>Coiled Pottery,</div>

<div class='unindent'>for it is very simple and easy at first, growing more difficult
only as one grows ambitious to attempt more intricate
forms.</div>


<div class='sectiontitle'>The Clay</div>

<div class='unindent'>ready for use you will find at any pottery. If it is dry
break into small pieces, put it in a large stone jar, and cover
with cold water; let it stand until thoroughly soaked
through and then stir with a stick until well mixed, and
work with your hands&mdash;squeezing and kneading until free
from lumps and perfectly smooth. When it is dry enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
not to be muddy, and is of the consistency of dough, it is in
good working condition.</div>

<p>Keep the clay always in the jar and closely covered that
it may not again become too dry.</p>

<p>Besides the clay you will need a table to work on, a
pastry-board, a thin block of wood about twelve inches
square, a wet sponge for cleaning and moistening your fingers,
and several simple tools.</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>The Table.</div>

<p>If you stand at your work, a tall office stool with rotating
seat will be just the thing you want, for by turning the
seat this way and that
you may look at your
work from all sides
without disturbing its
position. Any kind of
ordinary table will answer
the purpose, however.
On top of the
table or stool place
your pastry-board, and at the right-hand side the sponge,
which must be kept quite damp.</p>

<p>You will want but</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>Few Tools</div>

<div class='unindent'>as most of the work is done by the fingers alone. A short,
flat stick, sharpened on one side like the blade of a knife
(<a href="#Fig_321">Fig. 321</a>), an old penknife, a piece of round stick sharpened
at each end like <a href="#Fig_322">Fig. 322</a>, and some emery-paper are all
you will need at first.</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

</div>
<div class='unindent'>by turning it lightly between your hands (<a href="#Fig_323">Fig. 323</a>). When
the clay lengthens out lay it on the board, and roll under
your hands, as perhaps
you have done when making
dough snakes. Keep
your clay snake of an
even size its entire length,
be careful not to flatten
any part, and continue to
roll it with a light touch
until it is about the thickness
of your little finger.
Place your square block
on the stand before you,
and in the centre begin</div>


<div class='sectiontitle'>To Coil the Clay</div>

<div class='unindent'>(<a href="#Fig_324">Fig. 324</a>). When you have made a disk about two and one-half
inches in diameter, lift the roll and build up the sides,
coiling slowly round and round,
pinching it slightly as you go,
with the last row always resting
on the one just beneath
(<a href="#Fig_325">Fig. 325</a>).</div>

<p>Unless you have made a very
long roll, which is not easy to
handle at first, you will soon
have to stop coiling for lack of material. Do not use all of
the first roll, but allow the end to rest on the table, where it
can be joined to the new roll you are to make. Pinch the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
end of the new roll to
that of the old and round
the joint between your
hands.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. <a id="Fig_325">325</a>.&mdash;Lift the roll and build up the sides.</span>
</div>

<p>Continue coiling until
you have made a cup-shaped
vessel three
inches high, then break
off the roll and flatten
the end to meet the surface
of the brim. Moisten
your fingers on the
sponge, and smooth the
inside of the cup, holding
the walls in place with your left hand curved around the
outside (<a href="#Fig_326">Fig. 326</a>). Do not press too hard with either hand,
but slide your fingers gently round and round over the
inner surface. When the coils on the inside have become
well flattened mix a little clay and
water into a paste, and spread it
on, filling any cracks that may
still be left between the coils, constantly
smoothing all the time.</p>

</div>

<p>You will find that this process
has, at first, the effect of broadening
the base and lowering the
sides of the cup, and until you
have quite mastered the method
you must allow for the broadening
and flattening of your work.
Your cup, with a base of two and
one-half inches and sides three
inches in height, will now probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
be a saucer measuring about four inches across the bottom,
and not more than one inch and a half in height. It
matters little, though, at this stage what shapes you turn out.
Do your best with each piece, and if the work flattens turn it
into a pretty dish by pinching
the edge to form a little lip, and
adding a handle like <a href="#Fig_327">Fig. 327</a>.</p>

</div>

<p>As you are working without
a wheel the symmetry of
your pottery must depend entirely
upon your eye and
hand, therefore keep turning
the block upon which it stands
that no irregularity may be overlooked.</p>

<p>When you add ornaments or handles see that the roll of
clay from which you make them adheres closely to the
vessel. Add soft clay to the joints and smooth until the
whole seems to be of one piece.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. <a id="Fig_328">328</a>.&mdash;The outside corrugated
by the coil.</span>
</div>

<p>In your first attempts leave
the outside of the pottery corrugated
by the coils (<a href="#Fig_328">Fig. 328</a>);
later work you may smooth, making
a surface equal to that turned
on a wheel. Do not try to finish
a piece in one day; it is much
better to allow it to harden a
little and become set, then make
it as smooth as you can with your tools, levelling the edges
and taking away extra thicknesses. If this cannot be done
at one time, set the work away once more covered with a
damp cloth and it will keep in good working condition for
any length of time, but remember, the cloth must be kept
damp, otherwise the clay will harden.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>When you have perfected your piece of pottery to your
satisfaction put it away to dry, <em>not</em> in the sun. Several days
later, after it has become quite hard, go over the surface
again with knife and emery-paper, scraping and rubbing
down until it is entirely smooth and free from flaws. The
work will then be ready to take to the potter for firing.</p>

<p>The color of clay changes in firing, and your little piece
of pottery will probably come back to you almost the
color of old ivory. One cannot be very positive about the
color, however, for clays vary, and perhaps yours may be
of a kind that will fire another color. The potter will
glaze your work for you if you wish, or leave it in the
bisque. Nothing has been said about what</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>Shapes to Make the Pottery,</div>

<div class='unindent'>for that will depend much upon your own taste and ability.
Rather low, flat, dish shapes are most easily handled and
variations in the cup or flower-pot shape. After these may
come the jars and vases. Set a well-shaped piece of pottery
before you as a model to copy, until you have ideas of
your own to carry out, and learn to handle your clay before
attempting too ambitious a subject.</div><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

Florida; you will be charmed

sky is bluest, where winter is

the blue jay and a host of
other birds are on most friendly terms with girls and boys.
Go where the wild squirrels live unmolested in the beautiful
great live-oaks, whose branches are hung with long, soft
gray moss which swings and sways with the slightest breeze.
There you will find the home of many baby alligators,
queer little things whose eyes are provided with three
eyelids; one is transparent and slides across sidewise like
a window-glass to keep the water out of the eyes when
the little fellows want to see what is going on beneath the
surface. A number of baby alligators in a dry, sunny spot,
will delight in piling upon each other four and five deep.
The young owner of twenty of these pets declares that on
such occasions all the alligators sleep except one who,
wide-awake, acts as sentinel. At the approach of anyone
he will swing his long tail over all his companions to
awaken them and warn them of the danger that may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>

<p>All you need for the work
is a lump of soft clay, a
hat-pin, your fingers, and
determination to succeed.
Take a piece of clay (<a href="#Fig_330">Fig. 330</a>) and roll it between your
hands until it resembles <a href="#Fig_331">Fig. 331</a>. Push the two ends
together, causing the roll to hump up slightly near the
centre, lay it down on a board or any hard, flat surface, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
with the fingers carefully pat, squeeze, and push it into the
form of <a href="#Fig_332">Fig. 332</a>. Gently smooth out all roughness; then
nip off little
pieces of clay
from the big
lump for the
nose and two
eyes; stick them
on as in <a href="#Fig_333">Fig. 333</a>.
Again smooth
the rough edges
until the clay
looks like <a href="#Fig_334">Fig. 334</a>. With a
little careful
modelling you
can make the
head exactly like <a href="#Fig_335">Fig. 335</a>. Mark the eyes, mouth, and
nose with the flat point of the pin. If portions of the
head become too
thick, take off some
of the clay, and if
at any time the
head is worked
down too thin fill
in the hollow spots
with clay. In
modelling one can
always pinch off
pieces here and there
when necessary; or
add little bits,
smooth it all down,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
and the places altered will never show the marks of the
change.</p>

keep the clay moist, and begin to make</p>

your thumb along the sides, making the body the form of

two ends. For the tail pull from the large lump a smaller
amount of clay, roll it and model it like <a href="#Fig_338">Fig. 338</a>, larger at
one end than at the other. The last portion (<a href="#Fig_339">Fig. 339</a>), like
the others, is flat on the bottom, and with the exception of
a small triangle at the heavy end of the tail the two
sides meet at the top, forming a sharp ridge which decreases
in height as it tapers down to a point at the extreme end.

<p>Model two front and two hind legs and feet; see that
the hind feet and legs are larger and differently formed
from the front ones. The hind feet have only four toes
(<a href="#Fig_351">Fig. 351</a>). The line A (<a href="#Fig_340">Fig. 340</a>) designates the place
where the front legs should
be joined to the body, and
the line B (<a href="#Fig_340">Fig. 340</a>) shows
where to fasten on the hind
legs. That you may have a
thorough understanding of
the manner and direction in
which the joints of the legs
bend, we will suppose that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
you rest on the floor on your
knees and elbows. You will
then find that your knees bend
forward and your elbows backward,
with your arms corresponding
to the front legs and
your legs to the hind legs. Now,
when you draw or model hereafter,
you will not make any mistake
in regard to it. Look again
at <a href="#Fig_349">Fig. 349</a>. The foot, V, corresponds
to or rudely resembles
your hand; T, your wrist; P,
your elbow; O, your shoulder.
Examine <a href="#Fig_329">Fig. 329</a>. On the hind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
leg are the foot, ankle, knee and hip joint. While the alligator
is in a plastic state make him open his mouth, by
cutting a slit in the head from the front along the waved
line up back beyond the eye; carefully pull apart the jaws
(<a href="#Fig_352">Fig. 352</a>). Have your alligator measure at least fourteen
inches from tip to tip, for it will be more difficult to model
a smaller one. Once having made the little creature, you
will find it easy to model similar animals; select something
else in the same line and try to make it.</p>

<div class='sectiontitle'>A Head of Washington</div>

<div class='unindent'>modelled with your own hands
would have a double value. You
could show the head to your friends
and tell them how you made it, and
should they wish to become amateur
sculptors, you might help them with
their work. Make a thick cake of
clay for the bust. On the back part
of the top lay a small, round cake to
form the neck, and push a stick down
the centre of the neck through the
bust to the board beneath, allowing
a portion of the stick to extend up
beyond the neck; then roll a piece
of clay into the form of an egg for
the head&mdash;three times the size of a
hen's egg&mdash;and push it down on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
stick (<a href="#Fig_355">Fig. 355</a>). The stick enters
the head near the centre of one
side, so do not push the clay egg
on through one end. Continue to
push the head down until it meets
the neck. The stick is necessary
to give firmness and support to
the work. Model the head, neck,
and bust until it looks like <a href="#Fig_356">Fig. 356</a>. While modelling you must
not neglect any part of the head;
the work should go on at the sides
and back as well as the front;
every now and then turn the stand
on which your work is placed that
you may
model
other portions
of the head. In sculpture it
is essential that objects be made as
they are; therein lies the difference
between sculpture
and painting;
in painting
and drawing
objects are not
made as they
actually exist
but as they appear.</div>

<p>Be careful to study well the character of Washington's
face before going on with the work. Notice that it is
strong, the chin firm and square, the lips tightly closed and
the mouth almost a straight line, the nose not perfectly
straight but inclined to be aquiline, the eyes rather heavy-lidded;
and the hair, following the line of the head on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
top, is puffed out on the sides, covering both ears. <a href="#Fig_358">Fig. 358</a>
gives the front view, <a href="#Fig_359">Fig. 359</a> the profile, and <a href="#Fig_360">Fig. 360</a> the
back view of the head. Make the neck full and large. You
can keep the clay moist with a wet cloth and work on the
head a little each day. Persevere until you make so good
a likeness of George Washington that it will be recognized
at a glance, and ever afterward you will enjoy and appreciate
much more all portraits of him.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

how his pointed spears bristle
out in every direction, forming a
fine coat of mail (<a href="#Fig_362">Fig. 362</a>). If he
was only alive, he could coil himself
up into a prickly ball&mdash;not a
ball, though, that one could
handle without being hurt. This
little fellows differs from the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hystrix cristata</i>, or real porcupine, in that he did not wait
until his quills grew to turn into a ball, but was a ball to
begin with, for he commenced life as an apple, and an apple
is one of the nicest kinds of balls, as it may be tossed back
and forth and then eaten later.</div>



<div class="figcenter" style="width: 414px;">

<span class="caption">Fig. <a id="Fig_362">362</a>.&mdash;The apple porcupine.</span>
</div>

<p>If you can find an apple with a bump on one side, you
may make a porcupine in less than five minutes,
for all that is necessary is to stick the apple full
of wooden toothpicks, and that work will be as
easy as putting pins into a cushion. Let the
bump on the apple form the head of the animal.
Bend four toothpicks like <a href="#Fig_361">Fig. 361</a> and
push them up into the apple to serve as legs
and feet. Make the bent toothpicks balance
the apple perfectly, so that the porcupine will
stand firmly on its feet without other support. Use black
pins for eyes and broom straws for the whiskers. Stick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
them into the head of the animal as shown in <a href="#Fig_362">Fig. 362</a>.
Begin at the extreme back of the porcupine to insert the
wooden toothpicks that are to serve as quills; although
they are not hollow it makes very little difference, as this
wee creature cannot shake them, causing the quills to
knock against each other, as does the real animal when he
wants to produce a rustling sound to warn off an enemy.
Continue pushing in the toothpicks until the apple resembles
<a href="#Fig_362">Fig. 362</a>. Keep the quills inclined backward and be
careful not to have them stand out too far; slant the
quills as much as possible, as the length of the porcupine
must appear greater than the breadth. Now, if you could
endow the animal with life, you would find that he was a
vegetarian; that is, he could not eat meat, and you would
be obliged to feed him on fruit, roots, and certain kinds
of bark. You may be glad, though, that this porcupine
is only a "make-believe one," for, if he lived, he would sleep
all day and want to run about and take his exercise during
the night; and, more than that, you would feel very sorry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
for the poor little fellow, because he would be extremely
lonesome so far away from his native land of India, Africa,
or some part of Southern Europe. So of the two, all things
considered, the
apple porcupine
makes a better pet
for the small members
of the household.</p>

<div class='sectiontitle'>Little Sally Walker's
Head</div>

<p>(<a href="#Fig_363">Fig. 363</a>). With the small
blade of a pocket-knife
cut the eyes near the
centre of the apple,
placing them far apart
to give an innocent expression
to the face (<a href="#Fig_363">Fig. 363</a>). Cut the lower line
of the eyes straight and
the upper curved, as in
<a href="#Fig_364">Fig. 364</a>; then push the
small, pointed end of an apple-seed in the centre of each
eye; run the seed in so far that only a small portion of the
blunt end stands out (<a href="#Fig_365">Fig. 365</a>). Cut away a small, half-moon-shaped
piece of the skin (<a href="#Fig_366">Fig. 366</a>) to indicate the
nose. The mouth must be open and made the shape of
<a href="#Fig_367">Fig. 367</a>. Cut it into the apple a trifle more than an eighth
of an inch in depth. Make the curls of two narrow strips<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
of paper rolled up tight
like <a href="#Fig_368">Fig. 368</a>; then pulled
out as in <a href="#Fig_369">Fig. 369</a>. Pin
one curl on each side of
the head (<a href="#Fig_363">Fig. 363</a>). Cut
a round piece of white
paper for Sally's collar.
Make a small hole in its
centre and slip the collar
on the end of a stick;
then push the stick well
up into the lower part of
the head (<a href="#Fig_363">Fig. 363</a>). Keep
the collar in place by two
pins stuck through it into
the apple.</p>

<div class='sectiontitle'>The Indian</div>

<div class='unindent'>is very different in coloring
and expression from
Sally (<a href="#Fig_370">Fig. 370</a>). Notice
how near together his
eyes are; and see how
long and narrow his nose
is. If you examine the
face of the next red man
you see, or the picture
of one, you will probably
find that he has two
deep, decided lines from his nose to his mouth, and that
the mouth itself is firm and straight. Remember these
hints when making the Indian's head. Select a dark-red
apple, one that is rather long and narrow, if possible, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
the red man seldom has a round face. Cut two eyes of white
paper and pin them on the apple with black-headed pins
pierced through the centre of each eye. Make the long
nose of paper (<a href="#Fig_371">Fig. 371</a>).
Cut two slits close together
on the face and
slide the sides of the
nose (AA, <a href="#Fig_371">Fig. 371</a>) into
the slits (<a href="#Fig_370">Fig. 370</a>). Cut
two more slits, one on
each side of the nose,
down to the corners of
the mouth, and insert in
each a piece of narrow
white paper to form the lines; then cut one more slit for
the mouth and push in a strip of white paper, which may be
bent down to show a wider portion (<a href="#Fig_370">Fig. 370</a>). Last, but not
least, come the ornamental feathers. If you can obtain
natural ones so much the better; if not, make paper
feathers of bright, differently colored paper. <a href="#Fig_372">Fig. 372</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
shows how to cut them. Roll the bottom portion to make
a stiff stem and after punching holes in the top of the apple,
forming them in a row around the crown of the head, push
each feather in place, having the tallest in the centre, as in
<a href="#Fig_370">Fig. 370</a>. Run a slender stick up into the bottom of the
head and you will have something better than taffy-on-a-stick.</div>

His eyes are shaped

rather bluntly rounded

outer corners. Cut the
eyes like <a href="#Fig_374">Fig. 374</a> of
black paper and stick
them on the head
with white-headed pins
driven through the
centre of each. Let the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>

Japanese eyes grow. They never have eyes like Sally's.</div>

<p>Make the nose crescent-shaped, and pin it on with two
white pins. The mouth must be much larger than the
nose, though cut in similar shape. Hold the mouth in position
by running a row of white pins
through it into the head. The pins
will also form the Jap's teeth. Cut
the hair of black paper (<a href="#Fig_375">Fig. 375</a>); if
you have no black paper, make some
with ink. Fringe the hair as in <a href="#Fig_376">Fig. 376</a>; then fasten the circle of stiff black
hair on top of the head with black
pins. Use a russet apple or a yellow
one for the Jap, because, you know,
these people do not have red cheeks
or fair skins. When the head is
finished, push it down on the top of
a stick across which has been fastened
another shorter stick near the top
(<a href="#Fig_377">Fig. 377</a>). Make a simple kimono-like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a><br /><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>gown of paper and hang it on over the Jap's arms.
If you wish, you can paste the edges or seams of the garment
together (<a href="#Fig_373">Fig. 373</a>).</p>

<div class='sectiontitle'>Build a Tower</div>

<div class='unindent'>(<a href="#Fig_378">Fig. 378</a>). Cut the fruit into rather thick slices, select the
middle slice, that being the largest, and stick four toothpicks
into it (<a href="#Fig_379">Fig. 379</a>). Take the slice next in size and push
it down tight on top of the four toothpicks (<a href="#Fig_380">Fig. 380</a>). Stick
four more toothpicks into the second slice (<a href="#Fig_381">Fig. 381</a>), placing
the toothpicks in the spaces on the second slice between
the lower first four toothpicks (<a href="#Fig_381">Fig. 381</a>). On the tops of
the last toothpicks fasten another slice of apple, then stick in
more toothpicks and so on, always remembering to place
the top toothpicks in the spaces on the apple slice left between
the lower toothpicks. Build up the tower at least
seven slices high and do the work carefully, keeping the
toothpicks straight and even, that the apple tower may stand
erect and not resemble the famous Leaning Tower of Pisa;
for if your building should incline to one side, as does the
Pisa tower, it would not long retain that position, but the
entire structure would come tumbling down, obliging you
to try building again with another apple.</div>

<p><a href="#Fig_389">Fig. 389</a> is the pattern for Master Lamb's coat, which you
are to cut from a sheet of white cotton wadding,
opened through the centre to give the
wooliness of the raw cotton. A sheep's wool
does not grow long on its legs, so you need
not wonder that the lamb is not provided with leggings.</p>



<p>Paste the coat on the lamb's back and the little cap (<a href="#Fig_390">Fig. 390</a>) on top of his head and he will have all the clothing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>

shows how far the wool is to reach on his face, and that on
the top of his head gives the limit for the edge of the cap.</p>

get those plucked from the chicken for to-day's dinner, or
you may be allowed to take a few from mother's feather pillows

right shapes take a pair of sharp scissors and trim them
down to suit.</div>

<p>Select three feathers for the tail like the tail feather <a href="#Fig_391">Fig. 391</a>, and fit them in place on the goose to see just where
they are to go; then take them off, cover the tail with glue
and carefully put the feathers back in place, pressing them
down until they stick fast (<a href="#Fig_392">Fig. 392</a>). Find body feathers
like <a href="#Fig_393">Fig. 393</a> and, beginning near the tail,
cover part of the body with glue, then
stick the feathers on, overlapping them
as in <a href="#Fig_394">Fig. 394</a>. The under part of the
body must be entirely covered with these
feathers, but before going on to the breast
and neck the wing must be attended to.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. <a id="Fig_399">399</a>.</span>
</div>

<p>There are two kinds of wing feathers&mdash;some
long and narrow (<a href="#Fig_395">Fig. 395</a>), and
others much shorter (<a href="#Fig_396">Fig. 396</a>). Begin
at the lower edge of the wing and glue a
row of the long feathers in place, allowing
the lower edge of one feather to overlap the upper edge
of another, as in <a href="#Fig_397">Fig. 397</a>. Along the top edge of the wing
glue a row of the small feathers (<a href="#Fig_397">Fig. 397</a>), and then, beginning
again at the lower edge of the wing, cover the
remainder with the small feathers.</p>

<p>The short, broad feather (<a href="#Fig_398">Fig. 398</a>), is the kind to use on
breast and neck. Begin at the wing and fasten them on,
going upward until the head is reached, then trim off the
stems of the feathers to fit the space shown by the dotted
line on the goose's head (<a href="#Fig_399">Fig. 399</a>). Do not put too much
glue on the goose at one time, only enough for one row of
feathers, and spread it very thinly, for it takes but little to
catch and hold the light feathers in place.</p>

</div><div><br /><br /><br /></div><div class='drop-cap'>&quot;LIFTING" was one of the many
curious and interesting Easter
customs of the "good
old days" in merry
England, and we introduce
it here in the
form of a very jolly
Easter game.</div>

<p>First you must</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>Prepare the Pasch, or Easter Eggs</div>

<div class='unindent'>in this way: Select three large white eggs, make a minute
hole in the small end of each, and another hole the size of a
silver dime in the large end. Place the hole at the small
end of each shell to your lips and blow steadily until all the
egg has run out. Then set the shells in a warm place to
dry while you make ready "something bitter and something
sweet" with which to fill them. Soft, creamy candies
of a small size are the best for this. Select several
pieces for each egg, and pour on each of these one drop of
a weak solution of wormwood or quinine. Mix the bitter
candy with the sweet, and fill the egg-shells.</div>
<div class="figright" style="width: 285px;">
<img src="images/i_249.png" width="285" height="282" alt="" />
<span class="caption">Fig. <a id="Fig_400">400</a>.&mdash;Cut three scalloped disks like this.</span>
</div>
<p>Cut from gilt or colored paper three scalloped disks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
four inches in diameter (<a href="#Fig_400">Fig. 400</a>). Through the centre
of each disk pass a needle threaded with doubled black
linen thread, cover the under
side of the disk with
paste, separate the two
ends of the thread and
hold them down on each
side of the large end of a
shell, as shown in <a href="#Fig_401">Fig. 401</a>;
then draw the disk down
and paste it upon the shell
over the threads. If the
ends of the thread extend
below the disk, clip them
off with sharp scissors.
Wait until the paste is
quite dry and the paper
firmly attached to the shells, then hang the eggs by their
threads in a door-way so that they will be just one foot
higher than you can reach.</p>




<div class='sectiontitle'>The Game</div>

<p>There must be at least two girls and two boys to play
the game. Fold a shawl or wide scarf until it forms a narrow
band. Wrap it around the waist of one of the girls,
fasten it securely, and blindfold her with a handkerchief.
Let a boy stand on either side of her, grasp the band firmly,
and then march her up to the door-way where the eggs are
suspended, chanting these words:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Tid, Mid and Mi-se-ra,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Carling, Palm, and Pasch-egg day.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Lift you now off your feet,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Take your bitter with your sweet."</span><br />
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 216px;">
<img src="images/i_250.png" width="216" height="500" alt="" />
<span class="caption">Fig. <a id="Fig_401">401</a>.&mdash;Paste the disk on the shell.</span>
</div>

<p>Reaching the door-way they must halt just before it, and
when the girl says "Ready" she must jump, the boys at
the same time lifting her
by the band around her
waist. As she jumps she
must try to catch one of the
eggs. She can have but
one trial, and if she succeeds
in bringing down an
egg it is hers; failing, she
must wait until her turn
comes again for the chance
of securing a prize.</p>

<p>One of the boys must
have the next trial, while
the two girls become the
"lifters." The same ceremony
must be gone through
with for each player, a girl
and a boy alternately, and
the same verse repeated.</p>


<p>It is not necessary to
expend any strength in the
"lifting," for the players
should jump, and not depend
upon the helpers to be
lifted up within reach of
the eggs. When the eggs
have been pulled down, the
fun consists in eating the
candy, with always the
certainty of finding some
bitter drops among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
sweet, and the uncertainty of how soon and how often the
bitter will be found.</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>The Egg Dance</div>

<p>The egg dance is very old, so old that it is a novelty to
young people of this generation. It is said that this dance
formerly created much mirth, and no doubt it will afford
our modern girls and boys an equal amount of merriment.</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>The Eggs</div>

<p>To prepare for it, take thirteen eggs, blow the contents
from the shells, color eight red, gild four, and leave one
white. The object in removing the egg from the shell is
to save the carpet from being soiled should the eggs be
trampled on. If the carpet is protected by a linen cover
hard-boiled eggs may be used.</p>

<p>Place the eggs on the floor in two circles, one within the
other. The outer circle, formed of the red eggs placed at
equal distances apart, should measure about eight feet in
diameter; the inner circle, formed of the gilded eggs, should
be four feet in diameter, and the white egg must be placed
directly in the centre of the inner circle.</p>

<span class="caption">Angling for Easter eggs.</span>
</div>

<div class='sectiontitle'>The Dance</div>

<p>The eggs being arranged the company is divided into
couples, each in turn to try the dance. The first couple
takes position within the outer circle&mdash;that is, between the
red eggs and the gilded ones&mdash;and, to waltz music, they
dance around the circle three times, keeping within the
space between the two circles. Entering the inner circle
they waltz three times around the central egg, and all this
must be done without breaking or greatly disturbing any
of the eggs. When an egg is broken or knocked more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
twelve inches from its position, the dancers retire and give
place to the next couple. The broken eggs are not replaced,
but those out of position are set in order before the succeeding
couple commence the dance. When each couple
has had a turn and none have accomplished the feat, all
change partners and the trial begins again.</p>

<p>The first couple to go through the mazes of the dance
without breaking or disturbing any of the eggs win each a
first prize; the next successful
couple receive
second prizes, and the
third are rewarded with
one colored hard-boiled
egg which they may divide
between them.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. <a id="Fig_402">402</a>.&mdash;Eight hooks

</div>
<p>The appliances for
this game are manufactured
at home, and consist
of three toy hoops,
such as children use for
rolling, eight bamboo
walking-canes, and eight
hooks made of wire like
<a href="#Fig_402">Fig. 402</a>. A piece of
twine three-quarters
of a yard long
is tied to the small
end of each stick,
and to the other
end of the twine
is fastened a hook.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>



<p>Smooth, stiff, light-brown paper is pasted
or tacked over each hoop like a drum-head,
and in this paper covering of each hoop six
round holes are cut, just large enough to admit
the small end of an egg, or about the size
of a silver quarter of a dollar. Four of the
holes are made at equal distances apart, twelve
inches from the edge of the paper, and the
other two are near the centre (<a href="#Fig_403">Fig. 403</a>).</p>

<p>Eighteen eggs to be angled for are provided.
They are not boiled, but the shells are
emptied and prepared for decoration in the
manner previously described.</p>

<p>A circle of gilt paper is
folded twice, which forms <a href="#Fig_404">Fig. 404</a>, and an eight-pointed star
is cut by following the dotted
lines in <a href="#Fig_404">Fig. 404</a>. In the centre

the star, forming a loop; the ends are then pasted to the
point on either side of the star.</p>

<p>When the egg-shell has received its decoration, this star
and loop are glued to the large end of each shell, as shown
in <a href="#Fig_406">Fig. 406</a>.</p>

<p>In twelve of the egg-shells are hidden trifling gifts of
candy, a tiny penknife, silver thimble, or a trinket of any
kind; in four are slips of paper
on which are written "Prize
Ring," and in the other two are
also slips of paper; on one is
written "First Prize," and on
the other "Second Prize."</p>

<p>Every shell being supplied
with its gift the holes at the
small end of the egg are covered
by pasting over each a small
round of white paper, the edge
of which is cut in points to make
it fit more easily to the shell.</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>Rules of the Game.</div>

<p>1st. Eight players only can
take part in the game.</p>

<p>2d. The three hoops are
placed on the floor, paper side
up, at some distance apart. In
each of the two ordinary rings are placed six eggs standing
upright in the holes, small end down; four eggs contain
presents and two the papers bearing the words "Prize
Ring." In the third, or prize ring, are four eggs containing
presents, and the two which hold the papers with the
words "First Prize" and "Second Prize."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 238px;">
<img src="images/i_255.png" width="238" height="410" alt="" />
<span class="caption">Fig. <a id="Fig_406">406</a>.&mdash;Glue the star and loop to
the shell.</span>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>3d. There must be no distinguishing mark upon any of
the prize eggs.</p>

<p>4th. Four players stand around each of the ordinary
rings. Having once chosen their places they must keep
them until all the eggs have been taken from the ring.</p>

<p>5th. Every player is provided with a fishing-rod which
is held by one end, <em>not</em> in the middle.</p>

<p>6th. The endeavor of each player is to insert his hook
through the ribbon loop on one of the eggs and lift it out
of the ring, doing this as quickly as possible and catching
as many as he can.</p>

<p>As each egg is taken from the ring its contents are examined
and the player who first gets a prize-ring egg ceases
angling until the other prize-ring egg has been caught.</p>

<p>7th. When the eggs have all been taken out of both ordinary
rings, the two players in each ring who have the
prize-ring eggs move to the prize ring and angle for the
eggs which it contains.</p>

<p>8th. Two prizes, the first and second, fall to the lot of
the two players who are fortunate enough to secure the
prize eggs in the prize ring.</p>

<p>The prizes given for the prize eggs at the prize ring
should be of a little more importance than those contained
in the eggs. Instead of trinkets these eggs may contain
only candy, which will give more prominence to the two
real prizes given at the end of the game.</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>Table Egg-rolling.</div>

<p>Everyone knows about the egg-rolling where the eggs
are started at the top of a hill and rolled to the bottom, for
it has become almost a national game, being played annually
on the White House grounds in Washington on Easter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
Monday; but there is a new game of egg-rolling to be played
in the house, in which any person in any place may take
part. This is played, not with cooked eggs, as in the Washington
game, but with empty egg-shells, which have been
blown and left as nearly perfect as possible; and the field
for the game is a table with a chalked line across either end
about eight inches from the edge and another line directly
across the centre.</p>

<p>The players are divided into</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>Two Equal Forces</div>

<div class='unindent'>which take their places at opposite ends of the table. Each
player is provided with a fan and the egg-shell is placed
directly in the centre of the table on the dividing line. At
the word "Ready" all begin to fan, the object of each side
being to send the egg to its goal across the line at the opposite
end of the table, and to prevent its being rolled into
the goal at its own end.</div>

<p>On no account must the egg be touched except in placing
and replacing it on the centre line, which is done whenever
a score is made, and when the egg rolls off the table;
in all other cases it may be moved only by fanning. Each
time the egg enters a goal it counts one for the side at the
opposite end of the table, and when the score is marked the
egg must be replaced in the centre; then, at the given signal,
the fanning is renewed.</p>

<p>The winning score may be ten, fifteen, or twenty-five, but
it is best not to make it too large, for several short games
are more enjoyable than one long one.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

centuries were certain
games intended to represent
the adventures of
Robin Hood, that bold
forest chieftain who with
his band of merry men,
all clad in Lincoln green,
held many a contest with
bow and arrows; and though most of them were masters
of the sport, none could quite equal the leader, Robin
Hood.</div>

<p>From certain customs of these bygone days we can
evolve a delightful entertainment and call it the Twentieth
Century May day. The most important personage on this
occasion is the May Queen, who must win her crown by
skill in archery. The next in importance is the King who
wins his title in the same way. Of course,</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>Bows</div>

<div class='unindent'>and arrows will be needed for the sport, and these we will
make at home. They will be quite small and easy to manufacture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
but the bows, though
tiny, will work to a charm
and send the home-made arrows
flying with swiftness
and precision to their goal.
Look up a piece of flat rattan,
from which to form the
bow, such as is often used to
stiffen stays and dress waists;
cut it eleven and one-half inches
in length and burn a hole
in each end by boring through
the rattan with a hair-pin
heated red hot at one end
(<a href="#Fig_407">Fig. 407</a>). Holes made in this
way will not split or break the
rattan. Pass a strong linen
thread through the hole in one
end of the bow and tie it firmly
(<a href="#Fig_408">Fig. 408</a>); then bring the
thread across to the other
end, pass it through the hole,
leaving a stretch of eight and
one-quarter inches from end
to end of the bow, and tie the
end securely (<a href="#Fig_410">Fig. 410</a>).</div>

<div class='sectiontitle'>The Target</div>

<div class='unindent'>may also be home-made;
for this use a
small hoop&mdash;a barrel
hoop will do&mdash;and cover
it with paper. Take
any kind of paper
strong enough to hold,
but not too stiff, and
cut it three or four
inches larger in circumference
than the
hoop. Lay the hoop
down flat on the paper
and draw a line around its edge; then slash the paper
around the edge, cutting deep enough to almost reach the
circle marked by the hoop (<a href="#Fig_411">Fig. 411</a>). Cut silhouettes of
spring flowers from
various bright-colored
tissue-paper. Lay a
piece of tissue-paper
over each flower pattern
here given, and
trace the outline directly
on the tissue-paper.
Make a cowslip
(<a href="#Fig_412">Fig. 412</a>) of yellow
paper for the centre of
the target, and above
it place (<a href="#Fig_413">Fig. 413</a>) a
violet of violet tissue-paper,
and under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
centre fasten a Jack-in-the-pulpit
of green
tissue-paper (<a href="#Fig_414">Fig. 414</a>);
at the right attach a
pink azalia (<a href="#Fig_415">Fig. 415</a>)
and at the left a scarlet
tulip (<a href="#Fig_416">Fig. 416</a>).
Over the remaining
blank portion scatter
bright silhouettes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
other flowers. Each
wild blossom has its
own value: the yellow
centre cowslip counts
10; violet, 9; Jack-in-the-pulpit,
8; pink azalia,
7; scarlet tulip, 6,
etc. When the paper
flowers are ready, lay
the large target paper
on a perfectly flat,
hard surface; then,
using paste only
around the edges of
the flowers, fasten
each one in position
on the target paper,
beginning with the
central cowslip. When
finished turn the paper
over on the wrong side
and lay the hoop on it
over the circular line previously drawn. The hoop must
first have a strong staple driven in its top (<a href="#Fig_417">Fig. 417</a>). Turn
up the slashed edge of the paper and paste it down over
the hoop. <a href="#Fig_418">Fig. 418</a> shows a portion of the flaps glued over
it. Be sure when covering the
hoop to keep the paper perfectly
smooth and free from all wrinkles
or fulness, as shown in the target
(<a href="#Fig_419">Fig. 419</a>).</div>

<p>The delicate little blossoms of early spring need very

that they may be able to dig around and under the little
plants in order to take the flowers up root and all, with the
earth clinging to them (<a href="#Fig_420">Fig. 420</a>); each one can then be
carefully placed upright in
a flat-bottomed basket or
box and carried home in
safety. Better still would
be a number of tiny water-proof
paper flower-pots,
which may be purchased per
dozen for a trifling sum.
In each pot place one plant
with plenty of damp earth
surrounding it, and upon
reaching home tie a gay
narrow ribbon through
holes pierced on each side;
the little receptacle will
then make a charming May-basket,
and the wild flowers
will keep fresh and blooming
for a long time (<a href="#Fig_421">Fig. 421</a>).</p>



<p>While the King
and his men are
at work digging
up the plants the
Queen and her ladies
can gather the
buds and blossoms, picking them with as long stems as
possible and remembering to have a few green leaves of
each plant with its blossoms. To keep the flowers from
wilting, as they would if held in the hand, let each girl be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
provided with a clean, perfectly dry baking-powder can
which has a lid that fits tightly; the blossoms must be
without moisture and very carefully placed within the can
as soon as they are plucked. When the tin box is filled the
cover can be fitted on securely to exclude all the air. The
green leaves may be carried in the hand, and when they
droop they can be revived by being placed in fresh water.
The bit of wildwood brought home in the form of dainty
cut flowers could be put in water until dark, when the little</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>May-baskets</div>

<div class='unindent'>are ready for their reception. These baskets should always

<p>Manufacture the May-baskets of paper boxes, colored

resemble coral and are pretty when shaped like that shown
at <a href="#Fig_425">Fig. 425</a>. Make a ring of wire about the size of the top
of a very large teacup by twisting the two ends of the wire
together, then pull it into an oblong shape curved downward
at the two ends. Form another smaller ring, connect the
two by a length of wire fastened on one end (<a href="#Fig_422">Fig. 422</a>); twist
the wire on the bottom loop and bring it across the bottom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
and up on the other side end (<a href="#Fig_423">Fig. 423</a>). Proceed the same
way with the broad sides, extending the wire up and across
the top to form the handle (<a href="#Fig_424">Fig. 424</a>); if more braces are
needed, add them, and tie bits of string in knots of various
sizes at intervals all over the basket frame to form projections
for the branches of coral.</p>

<p>Transform the wire into coral by melting some white
wax and mixing with it powdered vermilion. While the
wax is in a liquid state hang the basket on the end of a poker
or stick and, holding it over the hot wax, carefully cover
the frame with the red mixture by pouring the wax over
the basket with a long-handled spoon. The wax cools rapidly
and forms a coating closely resembling coral; the little
lumps and projections that form give the basket the appearance
of real coral, which is branching and uneven.</p>

<p>As soon as the wax has hardened (<a href="#Fig_425">Fig. 425</a>) insert in the
basket a pasteboard bottom cut to fit; and when filling this
basket with flowers place the foliage around the sides first.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>

May-pole Game
for Country or

<p>If you live in
the country erect
your May pole on
the lawn or in an
open field; if in
the city put it up
in the back-yard,
or if it rains or
is cold hold your
May day games
in the house. In any case the pole should be planted in a
tub as in <a href="#Fig_428">Fig. 428</a>, and decorated as shown in the illustration.
The pole must be round and smooth and stout
enough to support the weight of the hoops at the top.
For an out-of-doors pole from ten to twelve feet is a
good height, but an indoor pole must be adapted to the
height of the ceiling of the room it will occupy.</p>

<p>Before placing the pole in the tub nail securely to its
base a piece of board eighteen inches square, as shown in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
<a href="#Fig_428">Fig. 428</a>. Erect the pole in the middle of the tub, put in

<div class='sectiontitle'>How to Dress the May-pole</div>

<p>Cover the tub with green crimped
tissue-paper and bank up with flowers&mdash;paper
flowers if no others can be obtained.
Beginning at the top, wrap the pole with
ribbon or strips of pink and white cambric
in alternate stripes. This can best
be done before the pole is erected. Buy
two toy hoops, the smallest measuring
about three feet, the largest four feet in
diameter. Wrap these hoops with greens
of some kind&mdash;evergreens if you can find no others&mdash;adding
sprays of tree blossoms and all the flowers you can
manage to get.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. <a id="Fig_430">430</a>.&mdash;On the end of each ribbon fasten a small
bell.</span>
</div>

<p>Besides the two large hoops you will need fourteen
small ones about nine inches in diameter. These you can
make of wire for yourself. Wrap eight of the small hoops
with pink, and six
with white cambric,
then decorate with
flowers and green
leaves. Keep the decoration
quite narrow,
in order to leave
as large an opening
as possible in the centre.
Get two and
two-thirds yards of
narrow pink ribbon
and two yards of
narrow white ribbon;
divide the pink
into eight and the
white into six pieces.
On the end of each ribbon fasten a small toy bell; tie the
ribbon on the small hoops, the white ones on the white
hoops, the pink on the pink hoops, as shown in <a href="#Fig_430">Fig. 430</a>.
Space the largest hoop off into eight equal parts and tie
the small pink hoops to it at these points by their ribbons.
Divide the other hoops into six equal parts and attach the
small white hoops in the same manner. With wire or ribbon
suspend the hoops from the top of the pole as in the
illustration. Decorate the top of the pole with small flags
and flowers.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a><br /><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>The Balls</div>

<p>Make four paper balls in this way: Take a piece of
newspaper and, placing a small weight of some kind in the
middle, crush it and roll it into a ball four inches in diameter;
place the ball in the centre of a square of tissue-paper
and bring the four corners of the paper together
over the top; overlap the corners and fold and smooth
down the fulness at the sides. Wrap the ball with fine
cord, making six melon-like divisions, as in <a href="#Fig_431">Fig. 431</a>. Make
two of the balls of pink tissue-paper
and two of white. Have ready on
a tray a number of small favors consisting
of two or three flowers tied
together, some with pink, some with
white ribbon.</p>

stands in the middle of the floor, and the children join
hands and dance around it to the accompaniment of the
piano or an appropriate song sung by all. Beginning with
slow time, the music grows faster; faster and faster the
wheel of children spins around the pole until some hand
slips from the one clasping it and the wheel parts.
When this happens the circle opens at the break and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
children, still keeping their places, back up against the
wall.</div>

<p>To the first four children at the right end of the line the
four paper balls are given, one to each. The first child, or
Number One, takes three steps forward and, aiming at the
bell in one of the hoops, throws the ball with the purpose of
sending it through the hoop and at the same time striking
the bell hard enough to make it ring. If successful, Number
One is given a favor, to be pinned to the front of the
coat or dress, as the case may be, the color of the ribbon
attached to the favor being in accordance with the color of
the hoop through which the ball passed. As it is more
difficult to send the ball through the hoops in the second
row, the white-ribboned favors confer the most honor.</p>

<p>As soon as Number One has played he or she gives the
ball to Number Five and returns to his or her place; then
Number Two takes a turn, giving his ball afterward to
Number Six, and so on down the line, thus always keeping
the children about to play supplied with balls.</p>

<p>The game goes on until the players are tired or the
favors give out, and the object of the players is to win as
many favors as possible.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<div class='sectiontitle'>Ghost Writing</div>

<div class='unindent'>is very mysterious and exciting. Dip a new clean pen
in pure lemon juice and with this queer
ink write mottoes or charms on a number
of pieces of writing-paper. Allow
the ink to become perfectly
dry, when it will fade out completely;
then place the charms
in a box and let each girl and
boy in turn draw what appears
to be a blank slip of paper.
After examining it, the paper
should be handed to some grown
person present who is in the
secret and who has provided a
lighted candle by means of which
he may read the ghost writing.
All the young people will cluster
around and with bated breath
watch the magical developing
of the words on the blank paper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
as the reader moves the message back and forth over
the lighted candle. The heat brings out the writing
in distinct letters that all may see. A second charm
must not be taken from the pile until the first has been
read aloud.</div>

<div class='sectiontitle'>Tasting Apple-seeds</div>

<div class='unindent'>which have previously been dampened and each dipped
into a separate flavoring. The moisture will cause the
spices, etc., to cling to the seed, giving various flavors.
Those dipped in liquids
must, of course, be
afterward dried. If to
your lot falls a seed
which has been powdered
with pulverized
cloves, your life companion
will never be
dull and uninteresting;
pepper denotes quick
temper; sugar, affection
and kindness; cinnamon
is lively, buoyant and
bright; vinegar, sour
and cross; gall, bitter
and morose; molasses,
loving but stupid;
lemon, refreshing and
interesting. Add as
many more flavors as
you wish. When the
seeds have been prepared
and dried wrap
each one in a small
piece of white tissue-paper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
and pass them around to the young people, allowing
each girl and boy to take two of the prophecies; then all
the children must be quiet while each in turn tastes first
one, then the other seed, telling aloud as he does so the
particular flavor he has received. Should a player find
the first seed sweet and the other sour, it would mean
that the disposition of the future wife or husband will
vary, partaking more of the stronger flavoring. If the
taste of the first apple seed is pleasant, the married life
of the player will be reasonably happy. If the flavor is
very agreeable, the married life will be very happy; if
the flavor proves unpleasant, it is best to remain single.</div>

<p>A very jolly time may be had with</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>Fortune Bags.</div>

<p>Purchase or make a number of brown paper bags of medium
size. In each place a simple little gift such as a tiny home-made
doll, a paper toy you have manufactured or a picture
of a young woman or man cut from a newspaper and pasted
neatly on a half sheet of fresh writing-paper, drop a nut
in the fifth bag and add other home-made gifts for other
bags, and label each appropriately. Pin a piece of paper
on the doll with these words written on it, "Dorothy's
new doll" (if none of the girls happens to have that name
use another in its place). Under the young woman's picture
write, "Marie when she is grown," and under the young
man's write, "This is Malcolm when he is a man." Change
the names if they do not represent any of the party. After
a gift has been dropped in, take the bags one at a time
and blow them full of air, do not allow the air to escape
while you wind a string around the openings and tie them
securely. The bags, being puffed out with air, will appear
much the same, rendering it impossible to tell, by merely
looking at them, which contain the largest gifts. All the
bags should be tied on a strong string, forming a fringe of
bags stretched across the room. The young people should
draw lots for first choice of the fortune bags, then each
player in turn must point to the bag selected, no one being
allowed to touch a bag until the leader has clipped it from
the string. Only one bag can be given out and opened at
a time, in order that all may see and enjoy the contents of
each separate fortune. All young people enjoy the fun of
trying their fortunes. Even when convalescent and not yet
quite strong enough to join in the general frolic, they may,
in a quiet way test many old-time and some new prophecies.
The three saucers is one as in the illustration. The apple
seeds charm commencing with "One I love" is another
and for new ideas there is The Feather test, Witch Writing,
etc.</p>

<div class='sectiontitle'>Make the Frog Jump</div>

<p>With a soft lead-pencil trace the frog (<a href="#Fig_449">Fig. 449</a>) on tracing-paper;
then transfer it to a very soft, pliable piece of
<em>white cotton mull</em> or any white cloth that will stretch readily
when pulled, for stretch it must, or the frog will not jump.
Turn the square of cloth so that it will resemble the ace of
diamonds in a pack of playing-cards, having one point up,
one down, one at the right and one at the left hand.
Fasten the cloth over a piece of white paper on a smooth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a><br /><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
board or table with thumb-tacks
or strong pins. Very carefully
place the tracing-paper, on which
you have drawn the frog (<a href="#Fig_449">Fig. 449</a>),
over the cloth, allowing the head
to come under the top point of
the square and the feet to extend
toward the lower point. Mr. Frog
may then be drawn exactly on the
bias weave of the cloth. When
you have finished the tracing, go
over the lines again with a soft
lead-pencil to make the markings
clear and distinct.</p>



<p>Look at the frog to be sure he
is correctly drawn; then remove
the pins and, allowing the cloth to
remain on the table over the piece
of smooth white paper, spread both
of your hands out on the cloth, one
at each side of the frog, and, keeping
your eyes on the drawing, move
your hands gradually outward, at
the same time moving the mull
with them. The stretching of the
bias material will cause the frog to
flatten out until he crouches for a
spring (<a href="#Fig_450">Fig. 450</a>). Cautiously raise
your hands up and off the cloth
and place them down again in a
different way; put one above and
the other below his Frogship, and,
still keeping your eyes on the figure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
suddenly move your hands, stretching the square up
and down, when the frog will give a quick leap and
spring straight upward in the most unexpected manner
(<a href="#Fig_451">Fig. 451</a>).</p>

<p>I wonder if you ever attended a concert where the
tenor had difficulty in reaching his high notes, where he
fairly seemed to rise up on his toes in his efforts to
attain the notes as his voice ran up the scale, and everyone
in the audience sympathized to such an extent that
they, too, felt like rising and stretching up their heads
in search of the difficult note. Such a tenor is shown at
<a href="#Fig_459">Fig. 459</a>. Trace him on bias cloth and pull the cloth out
sidewise (<a href="#Fig_458">Fig. 458</a>); then, beginning with the lower note,
<em>do</em>, slowly sing the scale as you leisurely pull the cloth upward
and downward at the same time. When you come to
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">sol</i> the face should be like <a href="#Fig_459">Fig. 459</a>, and as you continue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
singing and stretching the cloth, the tenor should resemble
<a href="#Fig_460">Fig. 460</a> when you reach your highest <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">do</i>. Though not a
very high note it is the best he can do, and he looks very
comical while his face is changing, his eyes and mouth
opening wider and wider and his hair rising up straight on
the top of his head.</p>

<p>You can have any amount
of fun with the moving figures
on your magic cloth if
you will remember the important
points, which we will repeat
to be sure you understand.
Have the squares of cloth for
all the drawings sufficiently
large to be easily manipulated.
Draw the design clearly and
distinctly. Draw it on the exact
bias of the cloth; move the
two sides of the cloth at precisely
the same time. Move
the cloth always with both
hands spread out flat on top of
the cloth. Place the cloth over
a large piece of white paper
that the picture may be plainly
seen. Care should be taken
to obtain soft cloth that will
stretch readily. These diversions
will afford fine sport for a
quiet evening and will be enjoyed
by the entire family. If
painted the designs will be still
more comical.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

you will spread out your little
hands and slide them together,
back to back, with the palms outward,

have a</div>


<div class='sectiontitle'>Queer Little Teeter-tarter</div>

<div class='unindent'>which will move when and how you wish. The two longest
fingers form the teeter-tarter; half of the teeter is on one
side and half on the opposite side of the fence. The fence
is made by the other parts of the hands, which, crossing
each other, fit snugly and tightly, leaving the teeter free to
swing back and forth at will. <a href="#Fig_461">Fig. 461</a> shows how your
hands should be placed together: the long finger marked
A is half of the teeter; the other half is on the opposite side.
Move the long fingers and watch the teeter go up and
down, first one end then the other, just like a real teeter
made of a board across a fence. If you bend back both of
your wrists, the right wrist will drop while the left wrist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
will be raised above it. This will bring one edge of the
fence or hands toward you, and looking down, you can see
both ends of the little teeter.</div>

of paste on the ball of the teeter finger of your left hand

finger of your right hand
will fix the paper children
securely on the teeter, and
you can make it go as fast

the two first fingers, without disturbing the remainder
of the hands; bring the raised

church, like any other building,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>

only look inside this building we might find them; move
your thumbs apart, or "Open
the doors and see all the people"
(<a href="#Fig_467">Fig. 467</a>). There they are sitting
in rows; don't you see
them? Now let the people
go up-stairs. Cross your two
smallest fingers on the inside,
which will bring the backs of
the hands toward each other;
keeping the little fingers together,
cross the third fingers,
next the second, then the first
fingers. The fingers on the left
hand form the stairs for the
people or fingers of the right hand to climb. Try it again,
allowing the people to ascend slowly one by one: "Here
are the people climbing up-stairs"

<div class='unindent'>place the inside of the little finger of the right hand on the
inside of the little finger of the left hand, and the inside
of the third finger of the right hand over the inside of the
third finger of the left hand; then bring the second and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
third fingers of
the right hand
up and over the
inside of the
palm of the left
hand, as in <a href="#Fig_470">Fig. 470</a>. Rest the
tip of the second
finger of the
right hand on
the tip of the
thumb of the
left hand. The
second finger is
the stick of
wood. Strike
the wood with the first finger of the left hand (C, <a href="#Fig_471">Fig. 471</a>);
raising that, bring down the second finger of the left hand
(B, <a href="#Fig_471">Fig. 471</a>). Keep them moving, first one, then the other,
and you will have "the
man chopping wood"
(<a href="#Fig_471">Fig. 471</a>). It is a pity
to waste the chips which
always fall when wood is
being cut, so let two
children, the thumb and
first finger of the right
hand, pick them up. Do
this by tapping the palm
of the left hand with the
thumb and first finger of
the right hand, while
the man cuts the wood.</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>The four fingers working at the same time make it quite
lively, but you will find that if the man chops fast, the children
will pick the chips very quickly, and if the man works
slowly the children will not hurry about gathering the
chips. It will be very difficult for you to have the man
chop slowly when the children are eager and quick at their
task. The feat will be almost as hard as patting your chest
with the left hand while you rub the right hand back and
forth over the top of your little head. You will laugh to
see the left hand rub, when you told it to pat; the poor
little left hand tries to mind, but just as soon as its twin
brother, the right hand, begins rubbing, the left hand has to
stop patting and rub too.</p>

The two pieces of paper

Now hold your first
fingers, on which the
birds are resting, out stiff
and double up the remaining
fingers; then let
your father see how well
you have taught these
little pet birds to mind,
for they will do exactly
as you say, going and
coming at your command.
Place the tips of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
your two first fingers on a chair, which you must pretend
is a hill, and raising first one finger to make the bird fly,
then the other, keep the pets flying up and down while you
repeat these lines:</p>

"Two little blackbirds sitting on a hill;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">One named Jack and the other named Jill.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Fly away, Jack!&mdash;"</span><br />
</div>

<p>As you say the last line raise the right finger up and back
over your right shoulder; while there, quickly bend down
the right finger with
Jack on it and stiffen
out the second
finger in its place.
Bring your right
hand down with
Jack hidden and
put the empty
second finger on the
chair instead of the
first. The bird will
be gone and lonesome
little Jill will
perch on the hill
with no playmate,
so you must let her
go too. Repeat
these words, "Fly away, Jill," and make her disappear as
you did Jack, bringing down the empty second finger of
your left hand and your father will find that both birds
have gone; but you may make them return by saying,
"Come back, Jack," as you raise your right hand and
close down the second finger while you straighten out the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
first and bring it again to the chair with Jack upon it.
Call Jill also that Jack may have some one to sing to, and
as you say, "Come back, Jill," bend down the second finger
and straighten out the first one with Jill on it, and let her
fly down to Jack. You may repeat the lines again and
again, making the pets come and go.</p>

<p>You can play</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>"Chin Chopper Chin"</div>

<div class='unindent'>with your sister, but you must be careful and touch her
face very lightly. As you say "Knock at the door," softly
tap her forehead, and at "Peep in," gently raise the outside
of her eyelid by pushing the top of your finger upward on
her temple near the eye, but not too near, as you might
accidentally strike the eye. "Lift up the latch" by slightly
raising the tip of her nose with the end of your finger. At
"Walk in" gently place your finger between her lips; end
the play by saying "Chin Chopper Chin" as you lightly
tap several times under her chin.</div>

right hand out flat on top of mine;" then I would place
my left hand over yours, and you would cover mine with
your left hand. That would make four hands all piled up
in a tower; but the moment your left hand came down on
top of mine I would pull my right hand out from under the
tower and lay it on top, covering your left hand; then you
would hurry to take your right hand from under the pile
and place it on top. So we would continue to play, always
drawing the hand out from the bottom of the pile and placing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
it on top until we were able to build the tower very

<p>(Figs. 477, 478, 479, 480, 481) on unruled white writing-paper

side of each little pig must be made into a ring (<a href="#Fig_482">Fig. 482</a>)
to fit the end of one of the five fingers on your right hand
(<a href="#Fig_476">Fig. 476</a>). Begin with "This little pig went to market"
(<a href="#Fig_477">Fig. 477</a>) for the thumb, next, "This little pig stayed at
home" (<a href="#Fig_478">Fig. 478</a>) for the first finger, then
"This little pig had roast beef" (<a href="#Fig_479">Fig. 479</a>)

had none" (<a href="#Fig_480">Fig. 480</a>) for the third finger; to
the little finger belongs (<a href="#Fig_481">Fig. 481</a>) "This
little pig said wee, wee, all the way home."
Adjust the bands until they fit perfectly,
then paste the end of each band under the
free side of the attached pig. If the bands
are too long they can be cut to proper
length. <a href="#Fig_482">Fig. 482</a> gives the wrong side of a
pig with band curled around and pasted on
back of pig, and <a href="#Fig_476">Fig. 476</a> shows how the Five
Little Pigs will look when on your fingers. If you can

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>HOW TO ARRANGE
FRESH FLOWERS</div>



<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_316.png" width="230" height="301" alt="I"/>
</div><div><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div><div class='drop-cap'>I &nbsp; THINK one must really love the
flowers in order to arrange them
perfectly. If you love them you
will feel in sympathy with them,
and that alone will help you to
understand what is needed to
bring out and emphasize their
exquisite beauty. Yet some
knowledge of the rules that
govern the best arrangement of
flowers is necessary also, for it saves many experiments
and makes the pretty task much more enjoyable and satisfactory.</div>

<p>You may crowd a room with the rarest and most expensive
flowers, but so arrange them that more than half of the
effect of their beauty is lost; and you may have only one
flower, but if it be the right kind of flower in the right kind
of vase, and placed in just the right spot, your room will
appear abundantly decorated and be filled with the beauty
and sweetness of the one blossom.</p>

<p>In a house where good taste always prevailed there
stood, one day, on the uncovered top of a grand piano a
tall, colorless, transparent vase which held just one long-stemmed
American Beauty rose. The queenly flower with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
its stem showing through the glass and the few green
leaves attached were all reflected in the highly polished
piano, and the effect of the colors reproduced in deepened,
darkened tones by the rich rosewood was indescribably
lovely. There were no other flowers and, though the room
was a large one, none were needed. One's eyes fell immediately
upon the rose when entering, and lingered there
with no wish to be drawn away by lesser attractions.</p>

<p>It was not merely a happy accident that placed the
one flower in its prominent and effective position, but the
experience and unerring taste of the daughter of the house.</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>Imagine a Number of Nasturtiums,</div>

<div class='unindent'>with no green leaves to relieve them, packed tightly into
the neck of a brightly colored porcelain vase, and set
primly on a stiff mantel-piece amid other prim ornaments.
Then think of a clear glass rose-bowl standing on a table,
where lie the newest magazines or books, filled and running
over in riotous beauty with the same nasturtiums in their
free, untrammelled state. The viney stems with leaf, bud,
and blossom drooping to the table or hanging over its edge,
and the other blossoms standing up in sweet liberty with
room to move about if they will. Can you hesitate between
the two arrangements? Yet I found the first in a flower-lover's
home.</div>


<div class='sectiontitle'>Do Not Crowd the Flowers</div>

<p>Few flowers look well packed tightly together and all
are better for loosening up a trifle. Purple violets are
almost the only flowers that will bear crowding, though
many think wild daisies adapted to this arrangement, and
spoil their beauty by making them into hard, tight bunches.
A good rule is to follow Nature as far as possible in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
direction. Flowers that grow singly and far apart, should
not be crowded, but those which grow thickly clustered
may be more closely massed.</p>

<p>It is almost always well to</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>Combine Green Leaves with the Flowers</div>

<div class='unindent'>although there are some that do not need this relief.
Closely packed flowers should have no foliage; chrysanthemums,
one species of the brilliant poppy and the sweet-pea
need none, but there are few others that do not show
better amid green leaves.</div>

<p>While flowers of different varieties seldom look well together,
you may sometimes add much to its beauty by
giving a flower the foliage of another plant, and a trailing
green vine will often be just the touch needed to soften a
stiff arrangement.</p>

<p>Asparagus fern is an airy and feathery green, but you
must use it with discretion, as it is suitable only for fragile,
delicate flowers in very loose arrangements. Other ferns,
though often used, do not really combine well with any
flowers, they are too distinctly another species of plant and
hold themselves aloof in their separateness. The wild
oxalis, wood-sorrel, or, as the children call it, sour grass,
has pretty delicate leaves that look well with sweet-peas
and other small flowers. As a rule, a flower's own foliage
suits it best, however, and you may be certain not to offend
good taste by keeping to it.</p>

</div>

<div class='unindent'>that are different in kind or color, it can seldom be done
successfully. To be sure, a mass of sweet-peas in all their
variety of color is very lovely, but even they are more effective
when separated into bunches each of one color. White<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
flowers sometimes are the better for a touch of color, and
white and yellow roses make a pretty combination, or
white and delicate pink, but the strong contrast of white and
dark red is not pleasing. Lilies should always have a
vase to themselves, and the Ascension lily must under all
circumstances stand alone. Neither the quality of the
flower nor the associations connected with it permit of its
being grouped with any other.</div>


<div class='sectiontitle'>Vases</div>

<p>In the careful arrangement of flowers your object should
always be to bring out their whole beauty, and let all else
be secondary to that. One vase, though beautiful in itself,
may not be at all suitable for holding flowers, while another,
of no value as an ornament, will display them to their best
advantage.</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>Colorless Transparent Vases</div>

<div class='unindent'>are always safe and in many cases absolutely necessary.
Give your roses transparent vases or bowls whenever possible.
If they have long stems, tall, slender vases, if their
stems are short the clear glass rose-bowls are more suitable.
Short-stemmed flowers do not look well in tall vases, and
a flower should always stand some distance above the top
of the vase. Someone gives as a rule that the height of
long-stemmed flowers should be one and one-half times the
height of the vase, but when the vase contains several, of
course the height must vary.</div>

<span class="caption">Fig. <a id="Fig_495">495</a>.&mdash;A cylindrical jar.</span>
</div>
<div class='sectiontitle'>The Vases and Bowls</div>

<div class='unindent'>need not be expensive, for they are now in the market at
extremely low prices. Knowing what to choose you can
find for a very moderate sum tall, slender vases with almost
no markings, that will show the long stem and so display the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
entire loveliness of the rose. <a href="#Fig_493">Fig. 493</a> is one of the least
expensive of these vases. Even the colorless glass olive-bottle,
shaped like <a href="#Fig_494">Fig. 494</a>, makes a pretty and suitable
vase, and an ordinary fish-globe displays the
rose-stems to far greater advantage than a
cut-glass rose-bowl. A clear
glass water-pitcher without
tracing of any kind is another
appropriate receptacle for these
lovely blossoms. When the
stems of any flowers have
beauty of their own, they
should never be hidden in
opaque vases. So it is not for
roses alone these transparent
vases are suitable.</div>




<div class="figright" style="width: 160px;">
<img src="images/i_321a2.png" width="160" height="279" alt="" />
<span class="caption">Fig. <a id="Fig_496">496</a>.&mdash;Another good
shape.</span>
</div>
<div class='sectiontitle'>Colored Vases and Jars</div>

<div class='unindent'>will sometimes enhance the
brilliancy of flowers of contrasting
or complementary colors.
A pale-yellow jar will
intensify the richness of the
purple of the violet, and a soft
green will harmonize with it
most delightfully. The neutral
gray often found in Japanese
ware will not clash with any color, and is especially
suited to brilliant red flowers; yellow flowers in a dark-blue
jar are quite effective.</div>

<p>Do not use ornate or highly decorated vases. No design
should conflict with the natural flowers, and the shape
of the vase should also be simple.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>Cylindrical jars, like <a href="#Fig_495">Fig. 495</a>, are suited to heavy clustering
flowers like the lilac and also to the large chrysanthemums.
<a href="#Fig_496">Fig. 496</a> is another good
shape; but avoid
vases like <a href="#Fig_497">Fig. 497</a>
with a neck so
small it will admit
only one or two
stems, while the
bowl is much too
large for the few
flowers standing
stiffly erect.</p>

</div>

<p>Place short-stemmed
flowers,
like the pansy and
violet, in low jars
or bowls, and it
is not necessary
to have them lie flat on the water. A
friend of mine has invented for her
own use this little</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. <a id="Fig_498">498</a>.&mdash;At
each end of the
wire make a
loop.</span>
</div>

<div class='sectiontitle'>Flower Lifter</div>

<div class='unindent'>which holds the flowers above the water
while allowing nearly the whole of their
short stems to be immersed.</div>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 101px;">
<img src="images/i_322b.png" width="101" height="555" alt="" />
<span class="caption">Fig. <a id="Fig_499">499</a>.&mdash;Bend
the loops over.</span>
</div>

<p>With an old pair of shears, or a
wire-cutter, snip off a dozen or more
pieces of copper wire of varying lengths
between ten inches for the longest and
five for the shortest piece. At each
end of every wire make a loop like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
<a href="#Fig_498">Fig. 498</a>; bend the loops over (<a href="#Fig_499">Fig. 499</a>), then
fasten all the pieces to a brass curtain-ring by
twisting each piece once around the ring at
the centre of the wire (<a href="#Fig_500">Fig. 500</a>). Bunch the
wires together and stand the lifter in a bowl of
water; put your flower-stems through the wire
loops, as in <a href="#Fig_501">Fig. 501</a>, and the wires
under water will look like the flower-stems,
the loops being hidden by the
blossoms.</p>





<div class='sectiontitle'>Symmetry</div>

<div class='unindent'>is pleasing and necessary in many
things, but not in the grouping of
flowers. You must strive for apparent
carelessness in effect while
taking the utmost care, and for irregularity
and naturalness rather
than stiff, formal arrangement. A
bowl of flowers need not look, as
it sometimes does, like a dish for
the table, served with the confectioner's
symmetrical decorations; it
should rather seem as if the sweet
blossoms were growing in a bed of
their own.</div>

<p>If you can take</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>Wild Flowers</div>

<div class='unindent'>up in a clump, roots and all; they
will look far better than the cut
flowers arranged in vases, and the
roots may afterward be planted in
your wild-flower garden.</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>


<p>Bloodroot will keep a long while if the roots are not
disturbed, and one of the loveliest flower-pieces we ever
had in the house was a gray-green Japanese bowl filled
with the growing bloodroot. The blossoms stand closely
together and a small bowl will hold quite a number.</p>


<p>Wood anemones, hepaticas, and wild violets are all
adapted to this temporary transplanting. I have kept ferns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
in this way for several weeks and the centre-piece for the
table in our mountain camp was at one time a clump of
maiden-hair fern in a small china bowl, which lasted fresh
and perfect many days. As there can be comparatively
little soil with the roots of these wild flowers, they must
be kept very damp all the while, and ferns, especially, will
do best when set in a pan or bowl of water.</p>

place of tropical decorations the young builders can use the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
most ornamental bouquets within reach, selecting foliage
and flowers which will keep fresh at least for a few hours.</p>

</div>


<div class='sectiontitle'>Playhouse of a Large Umbrella.</div>

<p>Tie a strong piece of twine securely to the end of each of
the ribs and tie the loose end of each piece of twine around
the notch cut in a pointed wooden peg a short distance from
its top. This will give an umbrella with a fringe of dangling
pegs. Open the umbrella and fasten the handle securely
to a long, sharp-pointed stick, binding the two together
with strong twine. First run one end of the twine
down the length you intend binding, allowing enough to tie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
at the bottom; then commence binding at the top over all
three&mdash;the umbrella handle, the twine, and the stick. Wind
the string around very tight, and when you reach the bottom,
tie the twine you hold to the loose end of the length
under the wrappings. Examine carefully and be sure the
handle does not slide or twist on the stick; then push
the point of the stick down into the ground at the place
decided upon for the playhouse. If you are not strong
enough to erect the house by yourself, ask some companions
to lend a hand and help sink the stick firmly in the
earth. When this is accomplished stretch out each length
of twine in turn and drive the peg in the ground (<a href="#Fig_503">Fig. 503</a>).
You will need a wide ruffle on the edge of the umbrella
of some kind of material full enough to reach around the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
outer circle of pegs on the ground beneath its lower edge.
The stretched twine will hold the ruffle out, forming an
odd little playhouse with a smooth, round roof and drapery
walls. Plait the ruffle and pin it on the umbrella with safety-pins;
also fasten it at the bottom to each peg (<a href="#Fig_504">Fig. 504</a>).
Newspapers pasted together and made of double thickness
may be used for the ruffle, if more convenient, but be
careful in handling the paper, as it tears readily. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>

<p>Get a dozen slender poles about as large around as a
broom-stick, and twice and one-half as tall as yourself. Tie
three poles securely together near the tops and stack the
others around the first three as a foundation or framework
for the house. Settle each pole firmly in the ground, forming
a circle, and bring the tops together at the centre,
where each pole should form a support for the others, and
all should lean against and across each other; then bind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
all the poles together at the top of the framework (<a href="#Fig_505">Fig. 505</a>). Covers of real wigwams are usually cut to fit
the framework and often decorated in savage fashion.
Sometimes they are composed of skins of wild beasts. If
you can make yours in Indian
style, it will be very realistic
and lots of fun. Find some inexpensive
dull-brown or gray
outing cloth or Canton flannel
and sew several lengths together.

be used in pinning the wigwam to the ground. The holes
must be continued along the entire edge of the covering.</p>

<div class='unindent'>similar to diagram (<a href="#Fig_506">Fig. 506</a>), making an immense cape-like

fits fairly well, hem the raw edges and bind the small, round
holes cut at intervals in the lower edge, to prevent them
from tearing. When finished tie each of the two top points
to a separate pole. Ask someone to assist you and let the
two poles be raised at the same time to the top of the Wigwam
framework; in this way the entire upper part of the
covering may be hoisted in place; then the sides can be
spread out and adjusted. Indians, having no chimneys,
always leave quite a large opening at the top of their
wigwams to serve this purpose; the space also admits
light into their houses. Commence near the top at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
place where the flaps are cut, and pin the fronts together
with large thorns or sharp-pointed slender sticks.
Fasten the fronts to within a few feet of the ground. The
opening left at the bottom takes the place of a door.
Sharpen as many wooden pegs as there are holes in the
bottom of the covering and push a peg through each
hole into the ground, bending the pegs outward a little
in order to keep the tent-like covering from slipping off
the tops of the pegs. The two poles attached to the
chimney points must now be carried backward on each
side of the wigwam, to be brought forward again when
desired (<a href="#Fig_507">Fig. 507</a>). When other material is lacking, shawls,
bedspreads, or sheets pinned together may be used for
your wigwam-cover.</div>

<p>These are very necessary in weighing different articles.
They can be made of the round covers of two large-sized
baking-powder or cracker cans (<a href="#Fig_514">Fig. 514</a>). Have the covers
exactly the same size, and punch three holes in the rim of
each at equal distances apart (<a href="#Fig_515">Fig. 515</a>). To obtain the exact
measurements for placing the holes, take a strip of paper
and wrap it smoothly and tightly around the outside of the
rim of the cover. Let the paper be a trifle
narrower than the rim of the lid, and be sure
to fold over the long end exactly where it
meets the first end (<a href="#Fig_516">Fig. 516</a>,
A). Remove the paper, cut
off the fold, and again try the
strip on the cover. See that
the measurement is perfectly
correct, then take the paper
off and fold it into three equal
sections, making two folds and two ends (<a href="#Fig_517">Fig. 517</a>), and for the third time wrap the strip of
paper around the cover rim. Mark the tin at
the point where the ends meet, and where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
two creases in the paper strike the tin; this will give three
marks on the rim equally distant from each other. Drive a
wire nail through
the tin rim at the
three marked places
to make the necessary
holes (<a href="#Fig_515">Fig. 515</a>);
then tie knots in the
ends of six pieces
of string of equal
length, and thread a
string through each
of the three holes in
each of the lids. Fasten the three strings on each lid together
at the top (<a href="#Fig_518">Fig. 518</a>). Cut a notch at each end of a
stick and tie the scales in place (<a href="#Fig_519">Fig. 519</a>).
Make two notches in the centre of the stick,
one on the top, the other on the bottom, and
tie a string around the stick at the centre
notches by which to suspend the scales.
This centre string may be fastened to an
overhanging tree-branch, or you can make a
support for it. Nail an upright stick to the
end of the counter and box, allowing it to
come a little below the board; then nail
another upright stick in the same way to the
other end of the counter. Notch the tops of
the uprights, lay a long, slender stick across
from one to the other and tie the centre string
of the scales on the cross-stick (<a href="#Fig_520">Fig. 520</a>).
<a href="#Fig_521">Fig. 521</a> gives an end view and shows exactly
how to nail the upright on the box and end of

<p>Acorns make fine
nuts. Gather a
quantity of them,
and for cabbage tie
a number of corn-husks
together, or
grape-vine or hollyhock
leaves; any kind of large leaves will answer the purpose.
Take a small, short stick and with a string wind the
ends of the leaves, one leaf at a time, on the stick, folding
the first leaf opposite to and inside the second, the second
in the third, and so on, always allowing each succeeding
leaf to overlap the last until the cabbage-head is large
enough; the resemblance to the real cabbage will be remarkable.
Spinach may be made of small leaves. For
asparagus pick a number of long, slender seed stems of the
plantain. Short, slender sticks placed in a glass jar may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>

Hold the lower right-hand corner

right hand forward, continue to bring it toward
you until it stretches out and up from

Hold these two corners together with the
right hand while with the left you roll the
bottom corner, held in that hand, outside,
forming the lower point of the cornucopia.
Fold up the bottom point to keep the cornucopia

<div class='sectiontitle'>Variety of Candy</div>

<div class='unindent'>manufacture it of strips of bright-colored paper rolled into
the form of paper lighters about the length and thickness
of ordinary stick candy. These mingled together in a separate
glass jar or piled upon the
counter add to the attractiveness of
the store. Hard lump candy of various-sized
pebbles will probably sell
well, but if upon trial the demand is
not as great as desired, you might
wrap each pebble in a bit of bright
paper to enhance its appearance;
then the customers will doubtless
invest more liberally in the gay-colored sweetmeats. Small
candy balls, red and white, may be made of the red and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
white clover-heads picked close to
the blossom, leaving no sign of the
green stem visible. Keep the different
colors separate, placing all of
the red clover candy flat down in
one layer on the inside of a box-lid,
where it will look bright and
pretty. The upturned edges of the
lid prevent the clover from rolling
out. White-clover candy will
appear to better advantage if you
place a piece of colored tissue-paper
in a box-lid, allowing the edges of
the paper to stand up a trifle beyond
the sides before arranging the
white clover in the lid. Gather a variety
of grasses, roots, and leaves,
tie them up in little bunches with
strings formed of several pieces of
long grass twisted or braided together,
and sell them as soup-seasoning
herbs. Large bouquets of
white clover-blossoms with long
stems and no leaves when bunched
together, forming a white mass on
the top, and then surrounded by
large green leaves tied in place with
braided grass, make excellent imitations of cauliflowers.
Use the round, flat hollyhock-seed for crackers; peel off
the outside green cover and the crackers will be white.
You can pretend large-sized poppy-seed vessels are green
tomatoes, which your customers will be glad to buy for
making pickles. Have everything connected with your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
store neat and orderly, and conduct it in a business-like
manner.</div>

<p>Do not forget to make bars of soap of moist clay or
earth. Have the clay only soft enough to mould and cut
with an old knife; when of the right consistency form the
cakes, making them all the same size. Cut the edges smooth
and even and lay the soap on a board in the sun to harden
sufficiently to handle with ease.</p>

<p>You might also use moist clay for butter, and cut off
portions as customers call for it, weighing the butter in your
scales to obtain the exact quantity desired by each purchaser.
Now try and think of other supplies you can make
of the moist clay.</p>

are held together in their pretty
green cup with its long green
streamers, which we call the
calyx. Is there any flower more
beautiful? See how daintily it
is formed, how exquisite the
coloring and how wonderful the texture! Could a manufacturer
furnish you with such enchanting material from
which to make your toys?</div>


<div class='sectiontitle'>Boats of Rose Petals</div>

<p>Carefully detach the rose petals one by one, beginning
with the outermost and largest. Be cautious not to bruise
or injure the fragile little things. Cut the sail and mast all
in one piece from tissue-paper (<a href="#Fig_538">Fig. 538</a>). Fold the mast
over twice, according to the dotted lines, that it may be
stiff and able to stand erect. Bend the lower portion of the
mast as in <a href="#Fig_539">Fig. 539</a>. Paste the inner sides of the fold together,
and it will form a flat piece extending out on each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
side of the mast (<a href="#Fig_540">Fig. 540</a>). Over the bottom of this spread
the least bit of strong paste or glue and place the mast well
forward on one of the largest rose petals. The portion of
the petal which grew inside the calyx forms the front part
or bow of the boat. Have the mast stand perfectly erect;
if it is inclined to bend toward either side, straighten it and
keep it upright. Before launching the vessel allow a few
moments for the glue to dry, then lift the boat very carefully
by the top of the mast with your thumb and first finger
and set it down on the water, which must be without
even a ripple. When once the boat is well launched the
waves may come with slight risk of damage to the craft.</p>

move the water as the boats lie at anchor, and watch the

boats will begin to move: the mingling of the different

make such a one of a rose turned upside down. Choose the
largest and most fully blown rose for the rose girl. Cut
the stem off about two inches from the blossom, and push a
common wooden toothpick through the stem midway between
the rose and the
end of the stem. The
toothpick forms the girl's
two arms (<a href="#Fig_543">Fig. 543</a>).</div>

</div>
<p>Fashion the head from
an old seed-vessel, which
you will probably find still
clinging to one of the rose-bushes.
First make a small
hole quite deep in the top
of the seed-vessel; then
push the end of the stem
of the rose up into the
head (<a href="#Fig_543">Fig. 543</a>). Run each
toothpick arm through a
green leaf and use a white
or pale-pink rose petal for
the girl's face (<a href="#Fig_544">Fig. 544</a>).
Pin the petal to the head
with four rose thorns,
using two for the eyes,
one for the nose, and one
for the mouth. Pin a rose
petal on the top of the head for a hat. Turn backward
two petals, without breaking them from the rose, to form
the dress waist; pin or gum one petal to the arms and neck
in front and the other to the arms and neck at the back.
Then stick three wooden toothpicks in the top of the rose
(<a href="#Fig_544">Fig. 544</a>); place the toothpicks so they will form a tripod,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
two on a line across the front and the third a trifle back of
and midway between the front ones. These three toothpicks
will enable the rose girl to stand alone; the two foremost
serve as legs and the other as a support. You can
make feet of two green leaves stuck on the ends of the two
front toothpicks (<a href="#Fig_544">Fig. 544</a>).</p>

Decorate one side, then
begin again at the bottom

the other side; finish the

the centre. Build the fence of
green leaves pinned together
at their sides with slender
sticks or broom straws;
stand the fence upright

of Roses," and decorate the four corners of a wee table with
vases which would rival in color and beauty the famous
"Peachblow Vase" for which such a
fabulous price was paid. Make the
little vases of large pink rosebuds;
those beginning to unfold are the best.
Peel off the outside petals and, grasping
each bud, in turn, near its base with
the thumb and first two fingers, gently
work it back and forth until it is loosened
and can be removed entire without
damage. Stand each vase on a
level surface and gather spears of grass
to place in them. Push some of the
grass ends down into the vases, but do
not crowd them; have only two or three
in each vase (<a href="#Fig_547">Fig. 547</a>). The pink color
of the vase will contrast pleasingly with
the green of the grass, and the feast will
be laden with the delicate perfume of
roses. You might candy different colored
rose petals by dipping them in
hot sugar syrup boiled until it spins
like a thread, and then drying the petals separately on
oiled paper; they will be appropriate for the party.</div>

Its equal could not be enjoyed in an ordinary dining-room.
There is no need of chairs when the party is
gathered around the feast, for the novelty and fascination
of sitting on the ground while dining are thoroughly enjoyed,
and everyone knows how delicious a mere bit of
bread and butter may taste when eaten from the low, green
table, the general enchantment of place and scene giving
an added flavor.</div>

<span class="caption">Going on a straw-ride picnic.</span>
</div>

<p>June is the ideal time for picnics; in this month there
are so many perfect days, when none should work, but all
should play, that one is prompted to plan for a little fun
and frolic, including an informal</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>Straw Ride,</div>

<div class='unindent'>which shall form part of the programme of the entertainment.
Choose for the ride a large, roomy wagon, remove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a><br /><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
all the seats except the one reserved for the driver, and fill
the bottom of the vehicle with plenty of fresh, clean straw.
Let all the party be seated on this, have within reach
warm wraps for protection in case of cooler weather or a
shower; and stow the luncheon away under the seat of the
driver. The horse should not be too spirited for such an
occasion, and the driver must be a strong, reliable man who
understands perfectly the management of the reins. Thus
equipped, with two or three grown persons in charge, the
girls and boys may throw care to the winds and enjoy their
ride over hill and dale, through sweet meadows and along
leafy lanes dappled with golden sunshine; again on the
highway, past field and wood, driving gayly along until the
picnic ground is reached.</div>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 157px;">
<img src="images/i_362.png" width="157" height="245" alt="" />
<span class="caption">Fig. <a id="Fig_562">562</a>.&mdash;Simon says
&quot;Thumbs up.&quot;</span>
</div>
<p>Should the ride be more than a mile or two, the way
may be beguiled with gay songs and choruses, or games in
which all may join while sitting quietly in their places.
Such a game is the old one</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>"Simon Says."</div>



<div class='unindent'>It is played with the hands only; each
person doubles up his right hand, resting
it on his lap and allowing his thumb to
stand erect (<a href="#Fig_562">Fig. 562</a>). When all are in
position the leader calls out: "Simon
says 'Thumbs down,'" at the same time
turning his thumb downward (<a href="#Fig_563">Fig. 563</a>).
All follow his example; then comes the
bidding "Thumbs up," and many will
resume the first position before they
realize that the leader omitted to prefix
the order with "Simon says." Therein<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
lies the catch, for no command must be obeyed unless it
comes from Simon.</div>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 203px;">
<img src="images/i_363a.png" width="203" height="193" alt="" />
<span class="caption">Fig. <a id="Fig_563">563</a>.&mdash;Simon says &quot;Thumbs
down.&quot;</span>
</div>

<div class="figright" style="width: 233px;">
<img src="images/i_363b.png" width="233" height="255" alt="" />
<span class="caption">Fig. <a id="Fig_564">564</a>.&mdash;Simon says &quot;Wiggle
waggle.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>The leader proceeds with "Simon says, 'Thumbs up,'"
then up must go all thumbs, and when "Simon says 'Wiggle
waggle,'" all move their thumbs
from side to side while the hand
rests in position (<a href="#Fig_564">Fig. 564</a>)&mdash;dotted
lines show the swing of the thumb.
If any neglect to do so it counts
one against him; next comes the
order "Stop"; the thumbs continuing
to wag, the leader calls
"Simon says 'Thumbs stop.'" The
leader may command a change in
the position and movement of the
hand and thumb according to his fancy, but the hand
cannot be unclasped nor the thumb folded down during
the game. Three failures count the player out, and he
must then content himself with watching the others until
the play ends. The leader, being privileged, follows all
directions in order to confuse
the others. The game is short,
consisting of ten commands
from the leader. It may be
played with sides, the group
dividing into two parties; the
young people at one end of the
wagon form one side, while
those at the other end constitute
the other side. The party
losing fewest players wins the
game.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span></p>

<p>Another interesting amusement, easily played as the
wagon rolls along, is the</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>"Bird Wish."</div>

<div class='unindent'>At a given signal each boy and girl must close both eyes
tight and make a wish, not opening the eyes until the leader
calls out "Look," when all may scan the blue heavens and
the surrounding country in search of birds. The first to
discover one cries out "Bird," which insures the fulfilment
of the wish. The other players are obliged to try again.
There being but three chances in this game, only three of
the company can be sure of successful wishes.</div>

<p>If more diversions are needed during the drive, try the
following</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>Word Tangle.</div>

<div class='unindent'>Ask each boy and girl to repeat in turn these lines:</div>

<div class='poem'>
"She says she sells sea-shells;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Shall she sell sea-shells?"</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>The words must not be recited too slowly, as that would
spoil the sport. Let the verse be said a trifle faster than
ordinary speech. The tongues of most of the players will
probably become twisted, causing the words to sound unintelligible
to the rest of the company, and a hearty laugh
will follow the effort. Only one trial is accorded each
player. When the line has gone the rounds, repeat in the
same manner:</div>

<div class='center'>
"Fred fetched freshly fried flying fish."<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>These little trials of skill in speech not only give you much
fun, but at the same time they cure hesitancy of speech and
brighten the mind; but do not let that frighten you and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
deter you from profiting by the sport. Never be afraid of
advantageous learning; let it come in what guise it may, it
will surely add to your pleasure as well as your worth.</div>

<p>When the picnic grounds are reached and all have had
time to look about, everyone will be ready for exercise.
So prepare for a grand rush after one of the group chosen as</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>The "Deer,"</div>

<div class='unindent'>who, stepping directly in front of the others, calls "Ready,"
when the group standing still immediately sings to the air
of "Yankee Doodle,"</div>

<div class='poem'>
"My heart is in the Highlands,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">My heart isn't here.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">My heart is in the Highlands,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Chasing the deer."</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>At the word "ready" the "deer" starts to run, and as the
pursuers cannot follow until the song is ended, the "deer"
has time to get a certain distance ahead before the others
give chase; this they do as they sing the last word in the
verse. The "deer" runs a short distance, circles around
and returns to the starting-point, or "home" as it is called,
the followers endeavoring to catch him before he reaches
his goal.</div>

<p>After resting from this game bring the rope from its
hiding-place in the wagon, also the long board stowed away
flat against the side of the vehicle, and in less time than
you imagine the rope can be securely fastened on a strong
branch of a tree to serve as</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>A Swing,</div>

<div class='unindent'>while the board may be used for a "Teeter-tarter"; balance
the plank across a log or the lower bars of a fence;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
then when two players take their seats at the ends of the
board, if it is properly adjusted, they will rise and sink alternately
as the ends move up and down, keeping time as the
players sing:</div>

<div class='poem'>
"Teeter-tarter, bread and water,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Come and see the pretty daughter."</span><br />
<br />
"See-saw, Margery Daw,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Came to town to study law."</span><br />
</div>

<p>If the players are of unequal weight, the heavier one
shortens his half of the plank by shoving it along farther
across the fence or log, preserving in this way the equilibrium.
To start the "Teeter-tarter" one of the players
should give a slight spring upward with the feet while retaining
his sitting posture on the board.</p>

<p>Prepare</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>The Dinner</div><div class="figleft" style="width: 78px;">
<img src="images/i_367a.png" width="78" height="168" alt="" />
<span class="caption">Fig. <a id="Fig_565">565</a>.&mdash;Picnic salt-box.</span>
</div>

<div class='unindent'>early, as the brisk drive in the morning air tends to stimulate
the appetite. Bring the lunch-boxes to the place selected
for the meal; let one person take full charge and
give directions, while the others unpack, build the fire, and
go to the spring for water.</div>

<p>The lunch should have been packed in paper boxes, to
avoid the care of baskets. In the first box might be the
loaves of fresh uncut bread and a tin baking-powder can of
sweet butter, the bread to be cut into thin slices, buttered
and prepared for sandwiches of various kinds. These can
be easily made by adding either the chopped nuts that have
been packed in a separate small box, or crisp lettuce leaves
which have been detached from the stalk, well cleaned and
sprinkled with fresh water, then carefully placed by themselves
in a box lined with waxed or oiled paper such as is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
used by confectioners for sweetmeats. Or the sandwiches
may be of sliced ham, tongue, roast-beef or lamb, each kind
of meat being folded in waxed paper and packed in its own
box. When the different articles of food are managed in
this way they are much more attractive and
palatable, each retaining its own flavor, and
there is no danger of their being mashed and
jumbled together, as happens too often when the
dinner is indifferently arranged and put together
in a thoughtless manner.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 94px;">
<img src="images/i_367b.png" width="94" height="168" alt="" />
<span class="caption">Fig. <a id="Fig_566">566</a>.&mdash;Paper over the
top.</span>
</div>

<p>The best way to carry salt, pepper, etc., is to
put each into a small paper box, the salt in one
of cylindrical form, the lid of which has previously
been punched full of holes with the aid
of a tack or a slender wire nail (<a href="#Fig_565">Fig. 565</a>). The
pepper can be in a smaller and differently shaped box, and
sugar in a box of still another size and shape, that there
may be no chance of mistaking one for the other and covering
the meat with sugar or trying to sweeten
the lemonade with salt. The perforations in
the lid of the pepper-box must be quite small;
punch them with a large-sized needle. After
the boxes are filled the lids can be fastened
securely with strong paste and, before they are
packed, may have paper tied down over the
tops (<a href="#Fig_566">Fig. 566</a>), to preclude all chance of the
contents sprinkling out during the journey.</p>

<p>If mustard is needed, it should be prepared
at home and carried in a small, wide-mouthed
bottle. Mayonnaise dressing is best conveyed
corked up in a small stone china jar, such as is often used
for jam.</p>



<p>Boiled, fried, or broiled chicken is always acceptable at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
a picnic dinner; the chicken must be well cooked, cut into
pieces and each portion wrapped in a separate piece of
waxed paper, then packed together in a box. Cold-boiled
asparagus or string beans, with fresh lettuce and mayonnaise
dressing, may take the place of a meat salad if desired.</p>

<p>Fruit is very refreshing and always welcome if consisting
of fresh berries, cherries, etc.; pack it in the same manner
as lettuce, omitting the sprinkling and washing.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. <a id="Fig_568">568</a>.&mdash;Flat sticks to use as spoons.</span>
</div>

<p>Of course, young people do not care for coffee, but the
grown ones would like it, and they must be remembered.
Grind the coffee and mix with raw egg; it may then be
carried in the tin coffee-pot, the coffee to be made after the
grounds are reached. If cake is taken, do not let it be rich;
sponge or plain cup-cake, made in layers with apple-sauce
between, is best.</p>

<p>As far as possible have the table equipment of paper,
that it may not be necessary to carry it back home. A tablecloth
composed of large sheets of smooth white wrapping-paper
will answer the purpose very well. Paper plates
such as are used by bakers, make excellent substitutes
for china ones and are
the very thing for outing
parties. Spoons may be
home-made, whittled of
wood; should the bowls
of the spoons prove too
difficult to manage, make
them like small shovels
(<a href="#Fig_567">Fig. 567</a>). If time will
not allow of this, flat, smooth sticks larger at one end than
the other (<a href="#Fig_568">Fig. 568</a>) may take their place. Knives are not
absolutely necessary. Only one need be taken, but that
must be of good size and sharp, to be used for cutting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
bread. It is a mistake to carry fine table linen or silver,
they always prove a great care and are apt to be injured
or lost, but not being skilled in the art of eating with chopsticks,
like the Chinese, you will have to be supplied with
forks. Take barely enough for the purpose and have them
of the most inexpensive quality; then it will not matter if
one or two happen to be lost. Only a few cups will be
required and no saucers; the company can take turns using
the cups. One item more&mdash;a pail for the water.</p>

<p>A small</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>Camp-fire</div>

<div class='unindent'>is very important. Build it on a spot where there is not
the slightest danger of its spreading, and into the embers
and ashes roll small raw potatoes. They will be delicious
baked&mdash;velvety black on the outside and, when broken
open while steaming hot, soft, mealy, and snowy white on
the inside. Before boiling the coffee, pile a layer of flat
stones on two sides of the fire and set the coffee-pot on
them, bridging across the open space over the fire. Water
can be heated in this way for tea or chocolate.</div>

<p>After luncheon gather all the boxes and paper and burn
them in the camp-fire, being careful not to put too much on
the fire at a time and waiting until one portion is burned
before adding more. The paper should be rolled in small,
tight balls to prevent a possible breeze from wafting it in
the air.</p>

<p>All can join in feeding the fire and enjoy</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>The Game</div>

<div class='unindent'>which accompanies it. When each one has secured his
contribution of box or paper, all must stand around the fire
and in turn cast the fuel on the flames. The first to do so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
begins telling any kind of an original tale which imagination
may suggest, such as,</div>

<div class='blockquot'><p>"The Prince, arrayed in gorgeous and rich apparel, was about to enter
his crystal palace when&mdash;&mdash;"</p></div>

<div class='unindent'>There he stops, because the rules of the game do not allow
one person to speak longer than his paper burns, but until
it is consumed he must not cease talking. The next in
turn drops her paper on the flame and continuing the
story, says,</div>

<div class='blockquot'>"he was startled by a peculiar noise from the grove near by. Rushing to
discover the cause, he saw something dark moving among the trees, it turned
and slowly approached&mdash;&mdash;"</div>

<div class='unindent'>Her paper having completely burned, the third player takes
up the plot, and tossing his box on the glowing coals, says,</div>

<div class='blockquot'>"Nearer and nearer the something came, when, lo! it proved to be a baby
bear walking erect and carrying in his paws&mdash;&mdash;"</div>

<div class='unindent'>So it goes on, and everyone adding a little, the story grows.
Each player being at liberty to turn the romance to suit his
mind, the story is apt to assume sudden and comical
changes, giving it a peculiar charm both to those who take
part and to those who listen.</div>

<p>A short, quiet time with jack-stones, played with small
stones found on the ground, will allow of sufficient rest before
participating in the exhilarating sport of</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>"Menagerie."</div>

<div class='unindent'>In this choose a keeper, whose duty it is to give the name of
a different animal to each player. Then all must form in
line for the grand march. Headed by the keeper, the procession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
twists and winds through the trees, this way and
that, returning soon to the starting-point, when all join
hands, forming a circle around the keeper who is then
blindfolded. The circle spins merrily around until the
keeper calls out "Jungle," the signal for all the players to
shout in chorus, each one giving the cry of the animal
he represents. After that they stand perfectly still. The
keeper next calls to one of the animals to enter the cage.
The player named must break from the circle and, standing
within the ring, gently give the cry peculiar to the animal
represented, at the same time changing his position so that
the keeper may not be able to catch him, as the latter tries
to do, guided by the cry. If the keeper succeeds at the
first trial, the two change places, and the game commences
over again, but without the march. Should the keeper not
be able to catch the animal in his first attempt, the bandage
must be removed from his eyes, and the circle standing
clasping hands and elevating them high in air, give space
for the animal to dart out of the cage, followed by the
keeper. In and out of the circle they run, going not more
than three times around the ring; if in that time the keeper
does not succeed in capturing his game, he must again be
blindfolded and stand in the middle of the ring while the
game continues. If captured, the animal becomes the
keeper and the keeper the animal.</div>

<p>Only a short while will remain before it will be time for
returning home, a few moments more for tumbling about
close to Nature; then comes the ride back home in the big
wagon filled with gay and happy girls and boys.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A PAPER CHASE</div>



<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_372.png" width="239" height="343" alt="F"/>
</div><div><br /><br /><br /><br /></div><div class='drop-cap'>FUN! Why what can compare with
it? The clear frosty air is full
of life, the blood is rushing tumultuously
through your veins
and your feet are tingling to be
off on the chase. It is healthful,
it is inspiring, it is glorious fun.
You must think, too, in order to
be successful either as hare or
hound, for the object of each is
to outwit the other, and Paper
Chase is a game that requires the
use of brains as well as muscle.</div>


<div class='sectiontitle'>The Hares and Hounds</div>

<div class='unindent'>compose the party. Two hares and as many hounds as
you will, the more the merrier. Each hare must carry a
bag filled with paper cut into small strips. The hounds
carry only the weight of their responsibility to entrap and
catch the hares.</div>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 408px;">
<img src="images/i_373.png" width="408" height="600" alt="" />
<span class="caption">Over Fences.</span>
</div>


<div class='sectiontitle'>The Game</div>

<div class='unindent'>is a country game, of course. Who would think of the hares
and hounds dashing in a mad run through the streets of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a><br /><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
town or village. And it is a noisy game with the Kee-ooi!
Kee-ooi! of the fleeing hares, and answering La-ha-hoo,
La-ha-hoo! of the pursuing hounds.</div>

<p>Select a convenient club-house or residence for the
meet and let there be two hares and at least six hounds.</p>

<p>The first thing to be decided upon is the distance of the
run, which should not be too great, especially for beginners.
The next is the agreement between the hares upon a general
plan to be pursued in their tactics, which must be kept secret
from the hounds.</p>

<p>The morning hours are best for the game, and a hearty
appetite for lunch, or the hunt-breakfast, it might be called,
is the result.</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>At a Given Time</div>

<div class='unindent'>let the hares start off together, scattering their bits of paper
as they go, to be followed ten or fifteen minutes later
by the hounds, who are led by the paper on the tracks
of the hares.</div>

<p>The object of the hares is so to scatter the paper in their
cross-country run as to lead the hounds on</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>A False Scent.</div>

<div class='unindent'>This is sometimes done by the hares making a detour into
a field, doubling back on their tracks and running in quite
another direction. Or they may provide a number of false
scents leading from one point.</div>

<p>To be sure all this uses up much precious time, but the
compensation lies in mystifying and delaying the hounds,
each of whom must decide for herself which trail is the
most likely to prove the one the hares have really taken.</p>

<p>When</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>The Hares Are Off</div>

<div class='unindent'>and the fifteen minutes up, the hounds must start in pursuit.
Their object is to head off and catch the hares before
they can cover the given distance and again reach
the place of meeting. A hound must not only come in
sight of a hare but must touch her in order to make a
catch. Each player in the paper chase acts for herself, and
if she succeeds in catching a hare she wins the honors.
And a hare reaching home without being caught wins great
honor. The hares keep together, but the hounds may
scatter at will, though no girl should risk going too far
alone.</div>

<p>From time to time the hares must give their cry Kee-ooi!
Kee-ooi! that the hounds may not go too far astray, and the
hounds reply with their La-ha-hoo! to let the hares know
they are on their tracks.</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>Over Fences, Across Brooks,</div>

<div class='unindent'>taking to the cover of the woods, or speeding along the
roads, it matters little how you get there, the object is to
reach the point you have decided upon over the shortest
route and in the least possible time.</div>

<p>This is the fun of it, the wild scramble over all obstacles
and the exultant moment when, if a hound, you have run
down the hares or, if a hare, you outwit the hounds and
make the home-run in safety. The game requires good
generalship on both sides, quick thought and ready decision.</p>


<div class='sectiontitle'>How to Dress.</div>

<div class='unindent'>A short skirt, loose, stout walking shoes, and a sweater
make the most comfortable costume. Wraps will be found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
in the way and uncomfortably warm, and you cannot run
very well in overshoes. If your feet get wet keep on
running and you will not take cold, but have a change
of foot-wear ready that you may replace wet shoes and
stockings with dry ones as soon as you reach the house.
Also throw a wrap over you upon your return so that you
may not cool off too suddenly after your long run.</div>

<p>Light bags for the hares to carry may be made of cotton
cloth with straps of the same to throw over the shoulder.</p>

<p>Good health, good-fellowship, good-nature, and fair play
are the requisites for the complete enjoyment of this most
exhilarating of all games.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a><br /><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>
